Words can't describe the debt I owe to her. If you enjoy this api, or just love cats, please donate to: NYC Animal Project Website NYC Animal Project Paypal Link NYC Animal Project is a struggling `no kill` cat shelter in the heart of new york that relies entirely on fosters and help from small donations. I can say personally having volunteered for them, even a few cents donation would make a difference for the very small organization. I fostered many kittens from them, and Pistachio was the runt that went un-adopted. She was shy, but very outgoing when she got settled. I highly recommend to foster and adopt if you can.

} The response contains two keys: availableColorNameLists and listDescriptions. availableColorNameLists is an array of all the color name lists currently supported by Color Names, such as Wikipedia, HTML color lists, traditional Japanese colors etc. listdescriptions is an object whose keys are the name of the color lists with values containing useful information such as title, description, source etc. In this demo, you can preview names of common colors given by each list. You can also change the input colors and the corresponding names in each list will be updated on the spot. Now when some of the requested colors are very similar you might get some duplicate names: $ curl'https://api.color.pizza/v1/?values=1b2b11,1c2f11,2e3f24&list=wikipedia'Notice how Phthalo Green was returned twice.
What makes this API unique is that you can ask to return a color name only once. So if you ask for similar colors the api will make sure to return a unique color name per requested color. $ curl'https://api.color.pizza/v1/?values=1b2b11,1c2f11,2e3f24&list=wikipedia&noduplicates=true'In smaller color name lists. This can lead to strage results. So we suggest using this feature with some the larger lists: default, bestOf, wikipedia, ntc, ral, ridgway or xkcd About Rest API that returns a bunch of color names for a given color-value Resources Readme License MIT license Activity Stars 49 stars Watchers 6 watching Forks 5 forks Report repository Releases No releases published Packages 0 No packages published Contributors 3 Languages JavaScript 98.5% Dockerfile 1.5% Footer ¬© 2024 GitHub,¬†Inc.

Use this data If you‚Äôd like to take advantage of the API that was put together for this, I added
a CORS header to these paths so that you can load them from a javascript app
anywhere on the internet. Random Taco Visiting: /random/ will get you a random Base Layer, Mixin, Condiment, Seasoning and  Shell. To
just get a random full taco recipe, call it thusly: /random/?full-taco=true Contributors If you‚Äôd like to get info about the contributors for a certain recipe,
you can call this endpoint: /contributors/:recipe_type/:recipe_slug/ So to get the contributors for the Delengua (Beef Tounge) Base Layer, do this: /contributors/base_layers/delengua_beef_tongue Valid layer types are: base_layers, mixins, seasonings, condiments and shells. To get a mapping of slugs for a given recipe type call this: /contributors/:recipe_type/ Contributions If you‚Äôd like to see who has made what contributions to which recipes, call this: /contributions/:github_username/ So, to get all of Dan Sinker‚Äôs contributions, call this: /contributions/sinker/ To get a listing of all contributors and their usernames, call: /contributions/ Want to help? This whole this is a relatively rudimentary Flask setup. After you pip install the requirements, you should be able to visit /cook/ to get a DB
together. The Flask app is looking for an environmental variable DATABASE_URL to
tell it how to connect to the database. Depending on what backend you‚Äôre using, you
might need to actually create the database, etc before it‚Äôll work.
I developed this with sqlite but you should be able to use any backend that
SQLAlchemy supports. You‚Äôll also need to set GITHUB_TOKEN as an environment variable. This is a
OAuth Token for the Github API.

If you are an information security researcher, or member of a CSIRT, SOC, national CERT and would like to access Metabase, please get in touch via e-mail or Twitter. Keep in mind that Public Dashboards are already using Metabase itself, but with prebuilt dashboards. Metabase access means you can run your own queries and create your own dashboards from scratch, but the web interface is the same. API documentation API is available at https://phishstats.info:2096/api/ and will return a JSON response. No account creation is required. Please note that running a massive amount of queries in a short time will get you blocked and/or banned. If you want to download the whole database, see the pricing above. New database fields are not being calculated retroactively. Logical operators can be: ~and ~or Comparison operators can be: eq (equal), ne (not equal), gt (greater than), lt (less than), like (not like) and not nlike (not like) and more. By default 20 records and max of 100 are returned per GET request on a table. Where _p indicates page and _size indicates size of response rows, for instance, /api/phishing?_p=2&_size=50.

Colormind API - extracting colors from photos and video Colormind Website Colors Templates Image Upload Colormind API Colormind has a REST API. The API allows you to access all the features that you see on Colormind.io. The API is free for personal and non-commercial use. If you're looking to use it in a commercial application, get in touch by email: jack@colormind.io To get a random color palette: curl 'http://colormind.io/api/' --data-binary '{"model":"default"}'
					
# {"result":[[214,78,69],[247,242,163],[201,216,147],[57,141,112],[62,80,64]]} To get color suggestions with input, label blank fields with the "N" character: curl 'http://colormind.io/api/' --data-binary '{"input":[[44,43,44],[90,83,82],"N","N","N"],"model":"default"}'
					
# {"result":[[49,47,49],[91,83,81],[133,155,143],[226,209,167],[235,198,126]]} You can use different models by passing in the model name. The models "default" and "ui" are always available, but others will change each day. To see which models are currently available, check the list endpoint: curl 'http://colormind.io/list/'
					
# {"result":["default","ui","makoto_shinkai","metroid_fusion","akira_film","flower_photography"]} The models are refreshed every day at +8 UTC (midnight PDT). The service will be down for 30 seconds while the new models are loaded into memory. Query the API in Javascript like so: var url = "http://colormind.io/api/";
var data = {
	model : "default",
	input : [[44,43,44],[90,83,82],"N","N","N"]
}

var http = new XMLHttpRequest();

http.onreadystatechange = function() {
	if(http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 200) {
		var palette = JSON.parse(http.responseText).result;
	}
}

http.open("POST", url, true);
http.send(JSON.stringify(data));

Safety Zone Reference Pages Core Docs Overview & Rules Request Formats Colors and Costs Card Imagery Layouts and Faces Frames Languages CORS and CSP Types & Methods Errors Lists Sets Cards Rulings Card Symbols Catalogs Bulk Data Card Migrations Beta Changelog API Changelog Changelog Feed API Documentation Scryfall provides a REST-like API for ingesting our card data programatically.
The API exposes information available on the regular site
in easy-to-consume formats. Endpoint Details The API is available at https://api.scryfall.com API requests are only served over HTTPS, using TLS 1.2 or better.
Requests will not be honored over plaintext HTTP. The API uses UTF-8 character encoding for all responses.
Many fields will include characters that are not in the ASCII range. Rate Limits and Good Citizenship We kindly ask that you insert 50 ‚Äì 100 milliseconds of delay
between the requests you send to the server at api.scryfall.com.
(i.e., 10 requests per second on average). Submitting excessive requests to the server may result in a HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status code.
Continuing to overload the API after this point may
result in a temporary or permanent ban of your IP address. The file origins used by the API, located at *.scryfall.io do not have these rate limits. We encourage you to cache the data you download from Scryfall or process it
locally in your own database, at least for 24 hours.
Scryfall provides our entire database compressed for download in
daily bulk data files. While we make incremental updates to card data daily,
take note that: We only update prices for cards once per day. Fetching card data
more frequently than 24 hours will not yield new prices. Updates to gameplay data (such as card names, Oracle text, mana costs, etc)
are much less frequent. If you only need gameplay information,
downloading card data once per week or right after set releases would
most likely be sufficient. Use of Scryfall Data and Images As part of the Wizards of the Coast Fan Content Policy,
Scryfall provides our card data and image database free of charge for the primary
purpose of creating additional Magic software, performing research,
or creating community content (such as videos, streams, podcasts, etc.)
about Magic and related products. When using Scryfall data, you must adhere to the following guidelines: You may not use Scryfall logos or use the Scryfall name in a way
that implies Scryfall has endorsed you, your work, or your product. You may not require anyone to make payments, take surveys, agree to subscriptions,
rate your content, or create accounts in exchange for access to Scryfall data. You may not use Scryfall data to create new games, or
to imply the information and images are from any other game besides Magic: The Gathering. When using images from Scryfall, you must adhere to the following guidelines: Do not cover, crop, or clip off the copyright or artist name on card images. Do not distort, skew, or stretch card images. Do not blur, sharpen, desaturate, or color-shift card images. Do not add your own watermarks, stamps, or logos to card images. Do not place card images in a way that implies someone other than Wizards of the
Coast created the card or that it is from another game besides Magic: The Gathering. When using the art_crop,
list the artist name and copyright elsewhere in the same interface presenting
the art crop, or use the full card image elsewhere in the same interface.
Users should be able to identify the artist and source of the image somehow. Repeated mishandling or misreprensation of data or images in your project
may result in Scryfall restricting or blocking your API access.

} Proudly powered by Fastly Created by David Marby & Nijiko Yonskai Source Having trouble? Poke @DMarby on Twitter Images from Unsplashassistant

It seems like you're describing the Lorem Ipsum for images, also known as Lorem Picsum. This is a tool that provides random, high-quality, and free images that can be used as placehold images for various purposes, such as web design, graphic design, and more.

The Lorem Picsum API offers various endpoints to retrieve images, including:

1. **Random Image**: Retrieve a random image by using the base URL with a specified width and height, such as `https://picsum.photos/200/300`.
2. **Specific Image**: Retrieve a specific image by using the `/id/{image}` endpoint, such as `https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300`.
3. **Static Random Image**: Retrieve the same random image every time by using the `/seed/{seed}` endpoint, such as `https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300`.
4. **Grayscale Image**: Retrieve a grayscale image by appending `?grayscale` to the URL, such as `https://picsum.photos/200/300?grayscale`.
5. **Blurred Image**: Retrieve a blurred image by appending `?blur` to the URL, such as `https://picsum.photos/200/300/?blur`.

You can also combine these options to create more complex requests, such as retrieving a specific image that is grayscale and blurred.

Additionally, Lorem Picsum offers a **List Images** endpoint to retrieve a list of images, which can be paginated using the `?page` and `?limit` parameters. The API also provides **Image Details** endpoints to retrieve information about a specific image, such as its author, width, height, and more.

If you're having trouble or need help, you can poke @DMarby on Twitter.

We use caching to prevent this from happening (see https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#common-options ). You can turn off these rate limit protections by deploying your own Vercel instance. Important We're a small team, and to prioritize, we rely on upvotes üëç. We use the Top Issues dashboard for tracking community demand (see #1935 ). Do not hesitate to upvote the issues and pull requests you are interested in. We will work on the most upvoted first. GitHub Stats Card Copy and paste this into your markdown, and that's it. Simple! Change the?username= value to your GitHub username. [![ Anurag's GitHub stats ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra )] ( https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats ) Warning By default, the stats card only shows statistics like stars, commits, and pull requests from public repositories. To show private statistics on the stats card, you should deploy your own instance using your own GitHub API token. Note Available ranks are S (top 1%), A+ (12.5%), A (25%), A- (37.5%), B+ (50%), B (62.5%), B- (75%), C+ (87.5%) and C (everyone). This ranking scheme is based on the Japanese academic grading system. The global percentile is calculated as a weighted sum of percentiles for each statistic (number of commits, pull requests, reviews, issues, stars, and followers), based on the cumulative distribution function of the exponential and the log-normal distributions. The implementation can be investigated at src/calculateRank.js. The circle around the rank shows 100 minus the global percentile. Hiding individual stats You can pass a query parameter &hide= to hide any specific stats with comma-separated values. Options: &hide=stars,commits,prs,issues,contribs![ Anurag's GitHub stats ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&hide=contribs,prs ) Showing additional individual stats You can pass a query parameter &show= to show any specific additional stats with comma-separated values. Options: &show=reviews,discussions_started,discussions_answered,prs_merged,prs_merged_percentage![ Anurag's GitHub stats ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show=reviews,discussions_started,discussions_answered,prs_merged,prs_merged_percentage ) Showing icons To enable icons, you can pass &show_icons=true in the query param, like so:![ Anurag's GitHub stats ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true ) Themes With inbuilt themes, you can customize the look of the card without doing any manual customization. Use &theme=THEME_NAME parameter like so :![ Anurag's GitHub stats ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&theme=radical ) All inbuilt themes GitHub Readme Stats comes with several built-in themes (e.g. dark, radical, merko, gruvbox, tokyonight, onedark, cobalt, synthwave, highcontrast, dracula ). You can look at a preview for all available themes or checkout the theme config file. Please note that we paused the addition of new themes to decrease maintenance efforts; all pull requests related to new themes will be closed. Responsive Card Theme Since GitHub will re-upload the cards and serve them from their CDN, we can not infer the browser/GitHub theme on the server side. There are, however, four methods you can use to create dynamics themes on the client side. Use the transparent theme We have included a transparent theme that has a transparent background. This theme is optimized to look good on GitHub's dark and light default themes. You can enable this theme using the &theme=transparent parameter like so:![ Anurag's GitHub stats ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&theme=transparent ) üëÄ Show example Add transparent alpha channel to a themes bg_color You can use the bg_color parameter to make any of the available themes transparent. This is done by setting the bg_color to a color with a transparent alpha channel (i.e. bg_color=00000000 ):![ Anurag's GitHub stats ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&bg_color=00000000 ) üëÄ Show example Use GitHub's theme context tag You can use GitHub's theme context tags to switch the theme based on the user GitHub theme automatically. This is done by appending #gh-dark-mode-only or #gh-light-mode-only to the end of an image URL. This tag will define whether the image specified in the markdown is only shown to viewers using a light or a dark GitHub theme: [![ Anurag's GitHub stats-Dark ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&theme=dark#gh-dark-mode-only )] ( https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#gh-dark-mode-only ) [![ Anurag's GitHub stats-Light ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&theme=default#gh-light-mode-only )] ( https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#gh-light-mode-only ) üëÄ Show example Use GitHub's new media feature You can use GitHub's new media feature in HTML to specify whether to display images for light or dark themes. This is done using the HTML <picture> element in combination with the prefers-color-scheme media feature. < picture > < source srcset =" https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&theme=dark " media =" (prefers-color-scheme: dark) "

Warning By default, the language card shows language results only from public repositories. To include languages used in private repositories, you should deploy your own instance using your own GitHub API token. Note Top Languages does not indicate the user's skill level or anything like that; it's a GitHub metric to determine which languages have the most code on GitHub. It is a new feature of github-readme-stats. Warning This card shows language usage only inside your own non-forked repositories, not depending on who the author of the commits is. It does not include your contributions into another users/organizations repositories. Currently there are no way to get this data from GitHub API. If you want this behavior to be improved you can support this feature request created by @rickstaa inside GitHub Community. Warning Currently this card shows data only about first 100 repositories. This is because GitHub API limitations which cause downtimes of public instances (see #1471 ). In future this behavior will be improved by releasing GitHub action or providing environment variables for user's own instances. Usage Copy-paste this code into your readme and change the links.

You can, however, use the &size_weight= and &count_weight= options to weight the language usage calculation. The values must be positive real numbers. More details about the algorithm can be found here. &size_weight=1&count_weight=0 - (default) Orders by byte count. &size_weight=0.5&count_weight=0.5 - (recommended) Uses both byte and repo count for ranking &size_weight=0&count_weight=1 - Orders by repo count![ Top Langs ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra&size_weight=0.5&count_weight=0.5 ) Exclude individual repositories You can use the &exclude_repo=repo1,repo2 parameter to exclude individual repositories.![ Top Langs ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra&exclude_repo=github-readme-stats,anuraghazra.github.io ) Hide individual languages You can use &hide=language1,language2 parameter to hide individual languages.![ Top Langs ] ( https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra&hide=javascript,html ) Show more languages You can use the &langs_count= option to increase or decrease the number of languages shown on the card.

If you host it on your own Vercel server, then you do not have to worry about anything. Click on the deploy button to get started! Note Since #58, we should be able to handle more than 5k requests and have fewer issues with downtime üòÅ. Note If you are on the Pro (i.e. paid) Vercel plan, the maxDuration value found in the vercel.json can be increased when your Vercel instance frequently times out during the card request. You are advised to keep this value lower than 30 seconds to prevent high memory usage. üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-step guide on setting up your own Vercel instance Go to vercel.com. Click on Log in. Sign in with GitHub by pressing Continue with GitHub. Sign in to GitHub and allow access to all repositories if prompted. Fork this repo. Go back to your Vercel dashboard. To import a project, click the Add New... button and select the Project option. Click the Continue with GitHub button, search for the required Git Repository and import it by clicking the Import button. Alternatively, you can import a Third-Party Git Repository using the Import Third-Party Git Repository -> link at the bottom of the page. Create a personal access token (PAT) here and enable the repo and user permissions (this allows access to see private repo and user stats). Add the PAT as an environment variable named PAT_1 (as shown). Click deploy, and you're good to go. See your domains to use the API! On other platforms Warning This way of using GRS is not officially supported and was added to cater to some particular use cases where Vercel could not be used (e.g. #2341 ). The support for this method, therefore, is limited. üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-step guide for deploying on other platforms Fork or clone this repo as per your needs Add express to the dependencies section of package.json github-readme-stats/package.json Lines 54 to 61

      in ba7c2f8 "main" : " src/index.js ", You're done üéâ Disable rate limit protections Github Readme Stats contains several Vercel environment variables that can be used to remove the rate limit protections: CACHE_SECONDS : This environment variable takes precedence over our cache minimum and maximum values and can circumvent these values for self-hosted Vercel instances. See the Vercel documentation on adding these environment variables to your Vercel instance. Keep your fork up to date You can keep your fork, and thus your private Vercel instance up to date with the upstream using GitHub's Sync Fork button. You can also use the pull package created by @wei to automate this process. üíñ Support the project I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can use this service for free. However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are a few ways you can do it: Giving proper credit when you use github-readme-stats on your readme, linking back to it. :D Starring and sharing the project. üöÄ - You can make a one-time donations via PayPal.

For more information about Transitland as a whole, and how to use the Datastore in particular, view the Transitland documentation site. This readme describes the Transitland Datastore behind the scenes: a Ruby on Rails web service (backed by Postgres/PostGIS), along with an asynchronous Sidekiq queue (backed by Resque) that runs Ruby and Python data-ingestion libraries. Note that this web application is designed to run at https://transit.land/api/v1 While you're welcome to try hosting your own instance, please keep in mind that the Transitland Datastore is intended to be a centralized source of data run by a community in one place (much like the Rails app that powers the openstreetmap.org API ).

US Presidential Election API | TogaTech Live Count More Information Free Backend API TogaTech Free US Presidential Election API (Backend) Credit is REQUIRED to use the API. Please make sure to mention the use of this API and a link to https://uselection.togatech.org/ when using the API in your projects (on your project pages that use this API, any documentation for code that uses this API, etc.). Copying the API or fetching data from our API and marking it as your own is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. To help keep this API free, we kindly request that you try to limit API calls to 30 seconds per server (get the data for your server and distribute from your server to clients). If we get too many requests as a result of programs calling this API too often, we will either shut down the API or start charging money for its use. The API is only available for use in backend systems to better distribute the load (servers fetch from the API and distribute the data to clients). We are enforcing this by having no 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header. For questions or help on the API, please email [email¬†protected]. Base URL: https://uselection.togatech.org/api GET /data Parameters: None Example (Node.js, ES6): const rp = require("request-promise");
const api_base = "https://uselection.togatech.org/api";
