We’re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our mission. We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.<br><br>Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 30 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.<br><br>Winnow’s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow has now worked with hundreds of sites to reduce food waste, including hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and high street restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% over 2 - 12 months, and maintained at these levels, with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers, and a net saving of staff time due to reduced food preparation and waste handling. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for restaurants. Watch our short videos on our YouTube channel to see the system in action.<br><br>We are passionate about living our values and place them at the centre of everything we do. We are excited about like minded talent who share these values, joining us in our mission:<br><br>Equal parts head and heart. We’re both passionate and measured. We carefully balance the need for quick solutions and pragmatism with the ability to step back, take in the bigger picture and build for the long term.<br><br>Bravely honest. With each other, that means we’re a transparent organisation where healthy, respectful debate is encouraged. With our customers, we challenge them if we don’t think they’re achieving their goals, whether they be environmental or financial.<br><br>People of action. Done is better than perfect, and we learn by boldly doing then rapidly improving. We’re breaking new ground, so we know things might go wrong. But we judge ourselves and each other on our reaction and our resilience.<br><br>Bound by food. We’re a diverse bunch, but our belief in the value of food is the common thread in everything we do. With each other, we celebrate through our love and respect for food. With our customers, it means we work hard to develop creative tools to make it easy for chefs to value food.<br><br>Hungry and humble. Our product is revolutionary, our people are impressive, and we’re hungry for change. But, we’re just the catalyst for a bigger movement. We stay humble regardless of our success, and make chefs the heroes in this journey.<br><br>People and Planet Positive. We’re caretakers of the planet, helping to preserve and support it for now and the future. Our work already minimises the impact that the hospitality industry has on the planet, and we’re also committed to actively reducing our own footprint while doing so.

However, the sensitivity and accuracy of current receivers fail the levels of performance 21st century businesses and individuals demand. Our revolutionary technologies transform the capability of all GNSS devices.<br><br>Blog<br>The role of S-GNSS® Auto in the vehicle ecosystem: Collaborative partnerships with OEMs and partners<br><br>As the concept of software defined vehicle (SDV) continues to gain traction in the automotive space, and the automotive supply chain gets more complex and technical, OEMs need to be in contact with details on the different software products available that were previously buried under Tier 1 or Tier 2 systems. Nowadays, almost all hardware components are driven by software; and GNSS is no exception. Software upgrades are crucial to extract the best possible performance out of the existing hardware. In this blog, we will explain how our innovative software upgrade enhances the performance of existing GNSS sensors and how OEMs work with FocalPoint to build S-GNSS® Auto into their vehicles.<br><br>While new platforms are inevitable and necessary in the automotive space, their planning and implementation is costly, complex and time consuming, and given a significant part of the performance of hardware components is determined by their software driver, it makes a lot of sense for OEMs to tend towards SDVs. Nearly all new vehicles include an onboard GNSS to provide various functions, including route guidance, map localisation and ADAS to name a few. OEMs should look to maximise the performance of this existing GNSS using S-GNSS® Auto, a software upgrade to an existing GNSS chipset.<br><br>S-GNSS® Auto, a GNSS solution for challenging roads<br><br>Environments like under foliage or urban areas where there is multipath have always been challenging to GNSS, and receivers have struggled to maintain adequate performance. S-GNSS is an upgrade to the GNSS receiver that works by using a synthetic aperture to exploit angle-of-arrival and target line-of-sight signals. In doing this, unwanted signals from bounces are automatically rejected and signals from the desired line-of-sight are boosted resulting in dramatic accuracy, sensitivity and reliability gains versus standard receivers. While the performance benefits have already been covered in detail in various other content (accuracy, sensitivity & reliability), this blog aims to address some of the nuances of S-GNSS - particularly its place in the vehicle ecosystem and how we work with OEMs and their supply partners.<br><br>S-GNSS® Auto is powered by our award winning Supercorrelation technology, and works by enhancing the GNSS receivers measurement engine. This means that an implementation of S-GNSS is tightly coupled to the specific receiver, and is why we need to work with the chip manufacturers to bring S-GNSS to OEMs. Once the specific implementation is developed, it may be possible to run S-GNSS downstream from the GNSS chip, depending on the surrounding architecture.<br><br>The critical importance of enhanced GNSS accuracy for ADAS and AV systems<br><br>GNSS is the only sensor capable of helping the ADAS to determine the vehicle's absolute position and trajectory. With S-GNSS® Auto we have a reliable solution that mitigates reflection suitable for hand-free driving in cities. Enabling cost-effective mass vehicle deployment, S-GNSS Auto® provides an affordable way for automotive OEMs and Tier 1s to significantly boost GNSS receiver accuracy, integrity and security - both for today’s ADAS systems and for tomorrow’s fully-autonomous vehicles.
