## Limitations

The `group_saml_identity` attribute is only visible to group owners for [SSO-enabled groups](../user/group/saml_sso/index.md).

The `email` attribute is only visible to group owners for [enterprise users](../user/enterprise_user/index.md) of the group when an API request is sent to the group itself, or that group's subgroups or projects.
