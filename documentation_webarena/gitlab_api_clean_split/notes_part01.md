# Notes API

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

Notes are comments on:

- [Commits](../user/project/repository/index.md#commit-changes-to-a-repository)
- [Epics](../user/group/epics/index.md)
- [Issues](../user/project/issues/index.md)
- [Merge requests](../user/project/merge_requests/index.md)
- [Snippets](../user/snippets.md)

This includes system notes, which are notes about changes to the object (for example, when an
assignee changes, GitLab posts a system note).
