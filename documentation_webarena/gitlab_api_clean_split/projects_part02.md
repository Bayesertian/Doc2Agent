## Project visibility level

A project in GitLab can be private, internal, or public.
The visibility level is determined by the `visibility` field in the project.

For details, see [Project visibility](../user/public_access.md).

The fields returned in responses vary based on the [permissions](../user/permissions.md) of the authenticated user.
