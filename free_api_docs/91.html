To only retrieve the latest year’s data, use:</p><p>https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=<strong>Nation</strong>&amp;measures=<strong>Population</strong>&amp;year=<strong>latest</strong></p><p>This call gives us the population of the US based on the latest available year of data. Using the string &quot;latest&quot; instead of a hard-coded year ensures that if the underlying data is updated with a new year&#x27;s worth of data, the API calls will all reflect this new data automatically. Additionally, to get data at the state level we can use:</p><p>https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=<strong>State</strong>&amp;measures=<strong>Population</strong>&amp;year=<strong>latest</strong></p><h2>Source</h2><p>You may have noticed some additional information returned with each API call. The <em>source</em> section identifies the underlying data table where the rows have been retrieved from for the given request. The <em>substitutions</em> section will indicate whether any input variables have been substituted for the purposes of providing data (instead of providing no data). If the subs dictionary is empty, then no subsitutions have been made.</p></div></div><footer id="Footer"><div class="footer-content"><div class="footer-links"><img id="datausa" src="/images/logo_sm.png" alt="Data USA"/><p>Explore, map, compare, and download U.S. data</p><div class="footer-column"><div class="link-column"><a href="/">Home</a></div><div class="link-column"><a href="/search/">Reports</a></div><div class="link-column"><a href="/visualize">VizBuilder</a></div><div class="link-column"><a href="/map/">Maps</a></div><div class="link-column"><a href="/about/background">About</a></div></div></div><div class="footer-contact"><form action="//datawheel.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=458059cf58ada1fd2b7de3e39&amp;id=9a3f9a9f32" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate" target="_blank"><div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"><div class="input-container"><input type="email" name="EMAIL" class="email" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="RECEIVE UPDATES ON NEWS, DATASETS, AND FEATURES?" value=""/><input type="submit" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="email-btn" value="Sign Up"/></div><div style="position:absolute;left:-5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_458059cf58ada1fd2b7de3e39_9a3f9a9f32" tabindex="-1" value=""/></div></div></form></div></div><div class="footer-logos"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html"><img id="deloitte" src="/images/footer/deloitte.png"/></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.datawheel.us/"><img id="datawheel" src="/images/footer/datawheel.png"/></a></div></footer><div class="" id="Banner"><span class="banner-text">COVID-19 in Numbers</span><button type="button" class="bp3-button close bp3-minimal"><span icon="cross" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="0" class="bp3-icon bp3-icon-cross"><svg data-icon="cross" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M9.41 8l3.29-3.29c.19-.18.3-.43.3-.71a1.003 1.003 0 00-1.71-.71L8 6.59l-3.29-3.3a1.003 1.003 0 00-1.42 1.42L6.59 8 3.3 11.29c-.19.18-.3.43-.3.71a1.003 1.003 0 001.71.71L8 9.41l3.29 3.29c.18.19.43.3.71.3a1.003 1.003 0 00.71-1.71L9.41 8z" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div></div></div>
