I'll help you search for UniProt entries for Homo sapiens on chromosome X within the specified genomic coordinates. Let me use the appropriate tool to retrieve this information.The search returned an empty result set, which means there are no UniProt entries for Homo sapiens (taxonomy ID 9606) that map precisely within the genomic coordinates X:58,205,437-58,219,305 on chromosome X.

This could happen for several reasons:
1. **No proteins encoded in this region**: The specified genomic region might not contain any protein-coding genes
2. **Annotation gaps**: The region might contain genes that haven't been mapped to UniProt entries yet
3. **Non-coding region**: This could be an intergenic region, intron, or contain only non-coding RNA genes
4. **Coordinate system differences**: There might be slight differences in the coordinate systems used

To provide more context, this genomic region spans approximately 13.9 kb on chromosome X. If you'd like to explore further, I could:
- Search with a slightly broader range to see if there are nearby proteins
- Search without the `in_range=true` parameter to find proteins that might overlap with this region
- Help you verify the coordinates or explore alternative search strategies

Would you like me to try any of these approaches?
