  "question": "Using the search_uniprot_entries_by_taxonomy_and_genomic_coordinates tool, identify all UniProt entries associated with Homo sapiens (taxonomy ID 9606) that are located within chromosome X at the genomic coordinates ranging from 58,205,437 to 58,219,305. Set the response format to JSON and retrieve the first 100 entries, ensuring only those that are precisely in the specified range are included.",

  "expected_answer": "The expected output will include a list of UniProt protein entries with information such as the protein names, descriptions, associated genes, sequence lengths, and corresponding genomic coordinates that precisely match the specified taxonomic identifier (9606) and genomic coordinate range (chromosome X: 58,205,437-58,219,305).",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll help you search for UniProt entries for Homo sapiens on chromosome X within the specified genomic coordinates. Let me use the appropriate tool to retrieve this information.The search returned an empty result set, which means there are no UniProt entries for Homo sapiens (taxonomy ID 9606) that map precisely within the genomic coordinates X:58,205,437-58,219,305 on chromosome X.\n\nThis could happen for several reasons:\n1. **No proteins encoded in this region**: The specified genomic region might not contain any protein-coding genes\n2. **Annotation gaps**: The region might contain genes that haven't been mapped to UniProt entries yet\n3. **Non-coding region**: This could be an intergenic region, intron, or contain only non-coding RNA genes\n4. **Coordinate system differences**: There might be slight differences in the coordinate systems used\n\nTo provide more context, this genomic region spans approximately 13.9 kb on chromosome X. If you'd like to explore further, I could:\n- Search with a slightly broader range to see if there are nearby proteins\n- Search without the `in_range=true` parameter to find proteins that might overlap with this region\n- Help you verify the coordinates or explore alternative search strategies\n\nWould you like me to try any of these approaches?",

The agent's response indicated an empty result set, which suggests that the search did not yield any relevant data. While the agent provided potential reasons for the lack of results, it did not attempt alternative strategies to verify or expand the search, such as adjusting the coordinate range or checking for overlapping entries.
