I'll help you convert this GWS format glycan structure to WURCS and analyze it against known structures. Let me start by converting the GWS format using the GlycoSMOS API.Great! The conversion was successful. Now let me get more details about this specific glycan structure using its GlyTouCan ID:Now let me validate the WURCS format to check for any structural issues:Now let me search for similar structures to compare this structure with known WURCS forms. Let me also check the partial match functionality:Let me also generate a visual representation of this glycan structure:Let me calculate the mass to compare with the API data:Now let me examine a few of the related structures for comparison:Based on my comprehensive analysis of the GWS to WURCS conversion and comparison with existing known structures, here's what I found:

## **Conversion Analysis Results**

### **Successful Conversion**
The GWS format structure `freeEnd--?b1D-GlcNAc,p--4b1D-GlcNAc,p--4b1D-Man,p--?a1D-Man,p$MONO,Und,0,0,freeEnd` was successfully converted to:
- **WURCS**: `WURCS=2.0/3,4,3/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c?-d1`
- **GlyTouCan ID**: G03717EM

### **Structure Validation**
The WURCS validation returned **no errors, warnings, or unverifiable elements**, confirming the structure is correctly formatted and valid.

### **Key Structural Features**
- **Composition**: 2 N-Acetylhexosamine (HexNAc) + 2 Hexose (Hex)
- **Mass**: 748.27495657 Da (matches API data: 748.27 Da)
- **IUPAC**: α-D-Manp-(1→?)-β-D-Manp-(1→4)-β-D-GlcpNAc-(1→4)-β-D-GlcpNAc-(1→
- **Classification**: N-linked, Monoantennary glycan

### **Critical Structural Difference: Unknown Linkage**
The most significant finding is the **ambiguous linkage position** indicated by `c?-d1` in the WURCS format and `?a1D-Man` in the original GWS format. This represents an **undetermined linkage position** between the two mannose residues.

### **Comparison with Related Structures**
The partial match search revealed several closely related structures with identical composition but **fully determined linkages**:

1. **G08918EL** (Fully determined): `c4-d1` - α-D-Manp-(1→4)-β-D-Manp linkage
2. **G22573RC** (Fully determined): `c6-d1` - α-D-Manp-(1→6)-β-D-Manp linkage  
3. **G81315DD** (Fully determined): `c3-d1` - α-D-Manp-(1→3)-β-D-Manp linkage
4. **G13008EW**: `d1-c3|c6` - mixed linkage pattern

### **No Discrepancies Found**
- **Mass calculations** are consistent (748.27 Da)
- **Composition** matches exactly across all related structures
- **WURCS format** is structurally valid
- **GlyTouCan ID** (G03717EM) is correctly assigned and well-documented

### **Biological Significance**
This structure appears in multiple species (human, mouse, rat, fruit fly, SARS-CoV-2) and is found on important proteins including:
- Immunoglobulin heavy chain epsilon (IgE)
- SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
- Various other glycoproteins

### **Conclusion**
The conversion is **accurate and consistent** with existing database entries. The structure represents a **partially characterized glycan** where the exact linkage position between mannose residues remains undetermined (`?` linkage), which is appropriately represented in both the original GWS format and the resulting WURCS notation. This ambiguity likely reflects experimental limitations in determining the precise linkage position, which is common in glycan structural analysis.
