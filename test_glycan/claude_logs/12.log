I'll search the UniLectin database for fungal lectins from Candida albicans and retrieve information about their fold and domain types.Let me try with a different approach, using a broader search pattern for the species name:Great! I found fungal lectins from Candida albicans. Let me get the complete dataset to analyze all the fold and domain types:Let me try without the UniProt column to avoid the error:Let me retrieve all the data to analyze the complete set:Based on my search of the UniLectin database for fungal lectins from *Candida albicans*, here are the lectin fold and domain types found:

## Summary of Candida albicans Fungal Lectins

**Total entries found:** 7 lectin entries (well below the requested 100, indicating this represents the complete dataset for this species)

## Fold Types

The fungal lectins from *Candida albicans* exhibit two distinct structural fold types:

1. **α/β barrel / TIM fold** - 5 entries (71.4%)
2. **β-sandwich / ConA-like fold** - 2 entries (28.6%)

## Domain Types

Two specific lectin domain types are present:

1. **chi-lectin (TCLL)** - 5 entries (71.4%)
2. **Yeast Emp L-type** - 2 entries (28.6%)

## Fold-Domain Combinations

The data reveals two unique structural combinations:

1. **α/β barrel / TIM fold with chi-lectin (TCLL) domain** - This is the predominant type, representing 5 of the 7 entries
2. **β-sandwich / ConA-like fold with Yeast Emp L-type domain** - This represents the remaining 2 entries

## Key Findings

The lectin repertoire of *Candida albicans* appears to be relatively limited but functionally specialized, with the majority of lectins belonging to the chi-lectin family with TIM barrel architecture. The presence of Yeast Emp L-type lectins with ConA-like folds suggests diverse carbohydrate recognition capabilities, which is likely important for this pathogenic yeast's interaction with host tissues and biofilm formation.

The chi-lectin (TCLL) domain type is particularly interesting as it's related to the tobacco lectin family and suggests these lectins may have roles in chitin binding, which is relevant for fungal cell wall biology.
