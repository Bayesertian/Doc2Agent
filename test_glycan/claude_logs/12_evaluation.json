  "question": "What are the lectin fold and domain types of fungal lectins found in the species 'Candida albicans', with a focus on the first 100 results available in the UniLectin database?",
  "expected_trajectory": "get_fungal_lectins",
  "expected_answer": "The answer should return a list of entries detailing the fold and domain types alongside the species 'Candida albicans' for the first 100 fungal lectins found. The information should include each entry's fold type, domain type, and confirmed species classification.",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll search the UniLectin database for fungal lectins from Candida albicans and retrieve information about their fold and domain types.Let me try with a different approach, using a broader search pattern for the species name:Great! I found fungal lectins from Candida albicans. Let me get the complete dataset to analyze all the fold and domain types:Let me try without the UniProt column to avoid the error:Let me retrieve all the data to analyze the complete set:Based on my search of the UniLectin database for fungal lectins from *Candida albicans*, here are the lectin fold and domain types found:\n\n## Summary of Candida albicans Fungal Lectins\n\n**Total entries found:** 7 lectin entries (well below the requested 100, indicating this represents the complete dataset for this species)\n\n## Fold Types\n\nThe fungal lectins from *Candida albicans* exhibit two distinct structural fold types:\n\n1. **\u03b1/\u03b2 barrel / TIM fold** - 5 entries (71.4%)\n2. **\u03b2-sandwich / ConA-like fold** - 2 entries (28.6%)\n\n## Domain Types\n\nTwo specific lectin domain types are present:\n\n1. **chi-lectin (TCLL)** - 5 entries (71.4%)\n2. **Yeast Emp L-type** - 2 entries (28.6%)\n\n## Fold-Domain Combinations\n\nThe data reveals two unique structural combinations:\n\n1. **\u03b1/\u03b2 barrel / TIM fold with chi-lectin (TCLL) domain** - This is the predominant type, representing 5 of the 7 entries\n2. **\u03b2-sandwich / ConA-like fold with Yeast Emp L-type domain** - This represents the remaining 2 entries\n\n## Key Findings\n\nThe lectin repertoire of *Candida albicans* appears to be relatively limited but functionally specialized, with the majority of lectins belonging to the chi-lectin family with TIM barrel architecture. The presence of Yeast Emp L-type lectins with ConA-like folds suggests diverse carbohydrate recognition capabilities, which is likely important for this pathogenic yeast's interaction with host tissues and biofilm formation.\n\nThe chi-lectin (TCLL) domain type is particularly interesting as it's related to the tobacco lectin family and suggests these lectins may have roles in chitin binding, which is relevant for fungal cell wall biology.",

While it attempted to retrieve information from the UniLectin database regarding fungal lectins from *Candida albicans*, the final output was incomplete and potentially inaccurate. The agent reported finding only 7 entries, which is significantly below the expected 100 entries, suggesting a failure to retrieve the full dataset. Additionally, the agent did not provide specific details for each entry, such as individual fold and domain types, which were required by the research question. The summary provided was too general and lacked the detailed breakdown expected.",

    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is questionable due to the incomplete dataset. The agent's interpretation of the fold and domain types was too generalized and lacked the specificity needed for meaningful scientific analysis. The conclusions drawn about the lectin repertoire of *Candida albicans* were based on insufficient data.",
