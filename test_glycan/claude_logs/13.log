I'll retrieve the molecular weight and canonical SMILES for the PubChem compounds you specified. Let me fetch this information for CIDs 5090, 7859, and 3615.Here are the molecular weights and canonical SMILES for the requested PubChem compounds:

**CID 5090:**
- Molecular Weight: 314.4 g/mol
- Canonical SMILES: CS(=O)(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=C(C(=O)OC2)C3=CC=CC=C3

**CID 7859:**
- Molecular Weight: 56.06 g/mol
- Canonical SMILES: C#CCO

**CID 3615:**
- Molecular Weight: 125.17 g/mol
- Canonical SMILES: CC(CC1=CN=CN1)N

These compounds have varying molecular weights ranging from 56.06 to 314.4 g/mol. The SMILES notation provides the structural representation of each molecule, showing their different chemical frameworks. CID 7859 appears to be a simple alkyne alcohol (propargyl alcohol), CID 3615 contains an imidazole ring (likely histamine), and CID 5090 is a more complex aromatic compound with sulfonyl and furanone groups.
