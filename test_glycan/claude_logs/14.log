I'll retrieve information about trefoil lectins found in the superkingdom of Bacteria from the UniLectin database, analyzing the domain, uniprot, and superkingdom fields.Based on the query to the UniLectin database, I found 2,001 trefoil lectins in the superkingdom of Bacteria. Here's what the data reveals:

**Summary of Trefoil Lectins in Bacteria:**

The database contains 2,001 entries of trefoil lectins from bacterial sources. From the sample data shown, I can see two main domain types represented:

1. **Ricin-like domain** - This appears to be the most common type among bacterial trefoil lectins
2. **Earthworm lectin-like domain** - Another domain type found in bacterial trefoil lectins

**Key Observations:**
- Many entries lack UniProt identifiers (showing as empty strings), suggesting these may be predicted or uncharacterized proteins
- Some entries do have UniProt accessions (e.g., A0A0M1J4I1), indicating characterized proteins
- All entries are confirmed to be from the Bacteria superkingdom

The high number of trefoil lectins found in bacteria (over 2,000 entries) indicates that these proteins are quite prevalent in bacterial genomes. Trefoil lectins are characterized by their distinctive three-loop structure and are important for various biological processes including cell adhesion, immune responses, and pathogen recognition.

Would you like me to analyze any specific aspects of these bacterial trefoil lectins in more detail, such as focusing on entries with UniProt identifiers or exploring particular domain types?
