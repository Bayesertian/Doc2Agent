I'll help you find the antigens related to those HPA antigen IDs and then explore their alignment with the specified Ensembl IDs. Let me start by searching for the antigens.The searches for both HPA antigen IDs didn't return any results. This could mean either the IDs don't exist in the database or they don't meet the minimum match score criteria. Let me try searching without the match score constraint to see if these IDs exist at all:The HPA antigen IDs 'HPA000123' and 'HPA000456' don't appear to exist in the UniProt antigen database. Now let me search for proteins associated with the Ensembl IDs you mentioned:Let me try a different approach to search for proteins by Ensembl IDs:The searches by gene ID also returned empty results. Let me try using the genomic database cross-reference search with a different approach:Great! I found information about the first Ensembl ID (ENSG00000139618). This corresponds to the BRCA2 gene, which encodes the BRCA2 DNA repair associated protein. Now let me search for the second Ensembl ID:The second Ensembl ID (ENSG00000248378) doesn't return any results in the UniProt database. Let me try a broader search to see if I can find any information about this ID:Based on my search results, here's what I found:

## HPA Antigen IDs Search Results

**HPA000123 and HPA000456**: These specific HPA (Human Protein Atlas) antigen IDs do not exist in the UniProt antigen database. I searched both with and without the minimum match score of 50, and neither ID returned any results.

## Ensembl IDs Analysis

**ENSG00000139618**: This Ensembl gene ID corresponds to the **BRCA2 gene** (BRCA2 DNA repair associated). The search returned multiple protein entries:

- **Gene**: BRCA2 (Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Protein)
- **Protein Function**: Tower domain-containing protein involved in DNA repair
- **Location**: Chromosome 13 (positions 32,316,461 to 32,398,767)
- **Key Features**: 
  - Contains multiple BRCA2 repeats
  - Has a Tower domain
  - Several isoforms/variants are available (A0A590UJ24, A0A590UJI7, A0A590UJU6, A0A7P0T9D7)

**ENSG00000248378**: This Ensembl gene ID does not return any results in the UniProt database, suggesting it may be:
- A non-protein-coding gene
- A pseudogene
- An annotation that doesn't have corresponding protein entries
- An invalid or obsolete identifier

## Summary

Since the specific HPA antigen IDs you mentioned don't exist in the database, I cannot provide alignment information between those antigens and the Ensembl genes. However, I can confirm that ENSG00000139618 corresponds to the well-characterized BRCA2 gene, which is a critical DNA repair protein. If you have the correct HPA antigen IDs or would like to search for antigens related to the BRCA2 protein specifically, I can help with that analysis.
