Now let me get the specific entry for BRCA1:Now let me search for TP53:Let me get the specific TP53 entry:Now let me try to get genomic coordinate information using the search_genomic_coordinates function with the proper UniProt accessions. First, let me find the UniProt accessions for these genes:Great! I can see that BRCA1 has the UniProt accession P38398. Now let me search for TP53:This shows an entry for ANO9/TP53I5, but not the main TP53 gene. Let me search more specifically:Let me try searching for the exact TP53 protein using a known UniProt accession:Good! Now let me get genomic coordinates for both proteins:The results are too large to display directly.
