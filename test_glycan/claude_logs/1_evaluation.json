  "expected_answer": "The function will return the WURCS format representation of the input glycan structure along with its corresponding GlyTouCan accession ID, which uniquely identifies the glycan within the GlyTouCan database. This will allow for easier integration and comparison with other data sources that utilize WURCS formats.",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll help you convert this complex glycan structure from IUPAC Extended format to WURCS format using the available glycan conversion tools.Excellent! The conversion was successful. Let me also try to get the GlyTouCan ID for this WURCS structure to see if it's registered in the database:Now let me validate the WURCS structure to ensure it's correctly formatted:Perfect! The WURCS structure is valid with no errors or warnings. Let me also calculate the molecular mass of this glycan:## Structural Representation Changes: IUPAC Extended to WURCS\n\nThe conversion from IUPAC Extended format to WURCS format shows significant changes in how the same glycan structure is represented:\n\n### Original IUPAC Extended Format:\n```\n\u03b1-D-Manp-(1\u21923)[\u03b1-D-Manp-(1\u21926)]-\u03b2-D-Manp-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-D-GlcpNAc-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-D-GlcpNAc-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-D-Glcp-(1\u2192O)Cer\n```\n\n### Converted WURCS Format:\n```\nWURCS=2.0/4,6,5/[a2122h-1b_1-5][a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-2-2-3-4-4/a4-b1_b4-c1_c4-d1_d3-e1_d6-f1\n```\n\n### Key Structural Changes in Representation:\n\n1. **Format Structure**: WURCS uses a highly compact, machine-readable format with four main sections separated by forward slashes, while IUPAC Extended uses descriptive chemical nomenclature.\n\n2. **Monosaccharide Encoding**: \n   - IUPAC Extended explicitly names each sugar (Manp, GlcpNAc, Glcp, Cer)\n   - WURCS encodes sugars as compact strings like `[a2122h-1b_1-5]` for basic sugars and `[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O]` for modified sugars (GlcNAc)\n\n3. **Linkage Information**:\n   - IUPAC Extended shows linkages as `(1\u21923)`, `(1\u21926)`, `(1\u21924)` with anomeric configuration (\u03b1/\u03b2)\n   - WURCS encodes this in the connectivity section `a4-b1_b4-c1_c4-d1_d3-e1_d6-f1`\n\n4. **Branching**: Both formats preserve the branching pattern, but WURCS represents it through its topology section rather than brackets.\n\n5. **Molecular Properties**: The converted structure has a calculated molecular mass of 1072.38 Da and validates without errors, confirming the conversion preserved the chemical structure accurately.\n\nThe WURCS format provides a standardized, unambiguous representation that's ideal for database storage and computational analysis, while maintaining all the structural information present in the original IUPAC Extended notation. This particular glycan structure is not currently registered in the GlyTouCan database, as evidenced by the \"Accession not found\" message.",
