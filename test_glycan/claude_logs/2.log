I'll help you find the reviewed UniProt entries for glycosyltransferase proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with your specific criteria. Let me search the UniProt database with these parameters.I see there's an issue with the sequence length format. Let me correct that and use the proper range format:The search returned an empty result set, which means there are **0 reviewed UniProt entries** that match all your specific criteria:

- Protein name containing "Glycosyltransferase"
- Organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (taxid 559292)
- Reviewed status: true (Swiss-Prot entries only)
- Sequence length: 400-800 amino acids
- Associated with GO term GO:0005975 (carbohydrate metabolic process)

This could be due to several reasons:
1. The combination of all these specific criteria is very restrictive
2. Glycosyltransferases in S. cerevisiae might not fall within the 400-800 amino acid range
3. They might not all be annotated with the specific GO term GO:0005975
4. Some entries might be unreviewed (TrEMBL) rather than reviewed (Swiss-Prot)

Would you like me to search with relaxed criteria to see what glycosyltransferases are available in S. cerevisiae, or would you prefer to modify any of the search parameters?
