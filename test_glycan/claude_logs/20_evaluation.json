  "agent_final_response": "I'll retrieve comprehensive protein information for UniProtKB ID 'P08047' using the get_proteins tool to analyze O-GlcNAcylation and other post-translational modifications.I encountered an SSL certificate issue with the O-GlcNAc Database. Let me try to retrieve information about this protein using the UniProt API instead, which should provide comprehensive protein information including post-translational modifications.Now let me retrieve specific post-translational modification information for this protein to better analyze O-GlcNAcylation:Let me try without the categories parameter to get all features:Based on the comprehensive protein information retrieved for UniProtKB ID P08047 (Transcription factor Sp1), I can now provide a detailed analysis of O-GlcNAcylation and other post-translational modifications.\n\n## Comprehensive Analysis of SP1 Protein (P08047)\n\n### **Protein Overview**\n- **Protein Name**: Transcription factor Sp1\n- **Gene Name**: SP1 (synonyms: TSFP1)\n- **UniProtKB ID**: P08047\n- **Organism**: Homo sapiens (Human)\n- **Length**: 785 amino acids\n- **Function**: Key transcription factor regulating expression of genes involved in cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and immune responses\n\n### **O-GlcNAcylation Sites and Extent**\n\nThe protein shows significant O-GlcNAcylation with **5 confirmed O-linked GlcNAc sites**:\n\n1. **Serine 491** - O-linked (GlcNAc) serine (confirmed in transactivation domain B)\n2. **Serine 612** - O-linked (GlcNAc) serine; alternate (in transactivation domain C)\n3. **Threonine 640** - O-linked (GlcNAc) threonine; alternate (near zinc finger region)\n4. **Serine 641** - O-linked (GlcNAc) serine; alternate (near zinc finger region)\n5. **Serine 698** - O-linked (GlcNAc) serine; alternate (in domain D)\n6. **Serine 702** - O-linked (GlcNAc) serine; alternate (in domain D)\n\n### **Other Post-Translational Modifications**\n\n**Phosphorylation** (extensive):\n- Multiple serine and threonine phosphorylation sites (Ser-2, Ser-7, Ser-59, Ser-101, Thr-278, Thr-453, Thr-739, etc.)\n- Mediated by various kinases including MAPK1/3, MAPK8, ATM, PKC/PRKCZ\n\n**Acetylation**:\n- N6-acetyllysine at position 703\n- Affects transcriptional activity through p300 recruitment\n\n**SUMOylation**:\n- Lysine 16 can be SUMOylated with SUMO1 or SUMO2\n- Modulates proteolytic cleavage and transcriptional activity\n\n**Ubiquitination**:\n- Occurs on C-terminal peptide, triggered by phosphorylation\n\n### **Functional Impact of O-GlcNAcylation on Metabolic Pathways**\n\n#### **1. Insulin Signaling and Glucose Metabolism**\n- **Insulin-mediated regulation**: The UniProt data indicates that \"insulin promotes nuclear location\" and \"levels are controlled by insulin and SP1 phosphorylation states\"\n- **O-GlcNAcylation contains 8 N-acetylglucosamine side chains** and is insulin-responsive\n- **Sequential modification**: \"On insulin stimulation, sequentially glycosylated and phosphorylated on several C-terminal serine and threonine residues\"\n\n#### **2. Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Shuttling**\n- **Location control**: \"Nuclear location is governed by glycosylated/phosphorylated states\"\n- **Hormonal regulation**: \"Insulin promotes nuclear location, while glucagon favors cytoplasmic location\"\n- This suggests O-GlcNAcylation acts as a metabolic sensor, directing SP1 subcellular localization based on nutrient status\n\n#### **3. Transcriptional Activity Modulation**\n- **Protein interactions**: O-GlcNAcylation \"affects transcriptional activity through disrupting the interaction with a number of transcription factors including ELF1 and NFYA\"\n- **Inhibitory effects**: \"Also inhibits interaction with the HIV1 promoter\"\n- **Competition with phosphorylation**: Several sites show \"alternate\" O-GlcNAcylation/phosphorylation, indicating dynamic competition between these modifications\n\n#### **4. Metabolic Gene Regulation**\n- **BMAL1 regulation**: SP1 \"positively regulates the transcription of the core clock component BMAL1,\" linking it to circadian metabolism\n- **VEGF pathway**: MAPK-mediated phosphorylation \"enhances VEGF transcription but represses FGF2-triggered PDGFR-alpha transcription\"\n\n### **Clinical and Therapeutic Implications**\n\n#### **1. Diabetes and Metabolic Disease**\n- The extensive O-GlcNAcylation and insulin responsiveness suggest SP1 is a key node in glucose sensing\n- Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation could contribute to diabetic complications\n\n#### **2. Cancer**\n- **Overexpression**: \"Up-regulated in adenocarcinomas of the stomach\"\n- **Telomerase activation**: \"maintains telomerase activity in cancer cells by inducing TERT and TERC gene expression\"\n\n#### **3. Oxidative Stress Response**\n- SP1 plays \"a role in protecting cells against oxidative stress following brain injury\"\n\n### **Sequence Information**\nThe protein sequence (785 aa) contains multiple functional domains:\n- Repressor domain (2-82)\n- Three transactivation domains (A: 146-251, B: 261-495, C: 496-610)\n- Three C2H2-type zinc fingers (626-650, 656-680, 686-708)\n- Domain D (708-785)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nSP1 represents a highly modified transcription factor where O-GlcNAcylation serves as a critical metabolic sensor. The modification pattern suggests that O-GlcNAcylation coordinates with phosphorylation to regulate SP1's nuclear localization, protein interactions, and transcriptional activity in response to metabolic signals like insulin and glucose availability. This makes SP1 a key integration point between cellular metabolism and gene expression, with significant implications for metabolic diseases and cancer.",
