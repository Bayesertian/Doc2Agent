  "expected_answer": "The expected answer would include the WURCS format representation of the glycan composition 'Neu5Ac(1)Hex(3)HexNAc(2)Fuc(1)' and its unique identifier ID provided by the Glycosmos database.",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll help you convert that glycan composition to WURCS format and find its corresponding identifier. Let me use the available glycan conversion tools.Let me try the alternative composition text conversion function:Great! The conversion was successful. Now let me try to obtain the GlyTouCan ID for this WURCS sequence:Let me also validate this WURCS to check if there are any issues:Based on the results, I can provide you with the following information about the glycan composition 'Neu5Ac(1)Hex(3)HexNAc(2)Fuc(1)':\n\n## WURCS Format Translation\n\nThe glycan composition translates to the following WURCS format:\n\n```\nWURCS=2.0/4,7,6/[Aad21122h-2x_2-6_5*NCC/3=O][axxxxh-1x_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][axxxxh-1x_1-5][a1221m-1x_1-5]/1-2-2-3-3-3-4/a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?}-{a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?_a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?}-{a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?_a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?}-{a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?_a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?}-{a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?_a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?}-{a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?_a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?}-{a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?\n```\n\n## Structure Analysis\n\nThis WURCS represents a complex glycan with:\n- **4 unique residue types**: Neu5Ac (sialic acid), HexNAc (N-acetylhexosamine), Hex (hexose), and Fuc (fucose)\n- **7 total residues**: 1 Neu5Ac + 3 Hex + 2 HexNAc + 1 Fuc\n- **6 linkages** connecting these residues\n\nThe residue definitions in the WURCS correspond to:\n- `[Aad21122h-2x_2-6_5*NCC/3=O]` - Neu5Ac (sialic acid)\n- `[axxxxh-1x_1-5_2*NCC/3=O]` - HexNAc (N-acetylhexosamine)\n- `[axxxxh-1x_1-5]` - Hex (hexose)\n- `[a1221m-1x_1-5]` - Fuc (fucose)\n\n## GlyTouCan/Glycosmos Database Status\n\nUnfortunately, this specific glycan composition does not appear to have a registered GlyTouCan accession number in the Glycosmos database. The conversion system indicates \"Accession not found\" when attempting to retrieve the unique identifier.\n\n## Validation Results\n\nThe WURCS validation shows that while the structure is syntactically valid, there are some warnings about \"too many linkages on the backbone\" for each residue position. This suggests that the composition-to-WURCS conversion has generated a structure with ambiguous or undefined linkage positions (indicated by the \"a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?\" notation), which is typical when converting from composition data that doesn't specify exact linkage positions and anomeric configurations.\n\nThis glycan composition represents a complex N-linked or O-linked glycan structure commonly found in glycoproteins, containing sialic acid, fucose, and multiple hexose and N-acetylhexosamine residues.",
