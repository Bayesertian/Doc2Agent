I'll search for glycosylation-related protein sequence features in the human hemoglobin proteins you specified. Let me query the UniProt database for both accession numbers to find post-translational modifications related to carbohydrates.Let me correct the parameter format and try again:Let me check the function documentation to understand the correct parameter format:I see the issue. The categories should use "PTM" instead of "POST_TRANSLATIONAL_MODIFICATIONS". Let me try with the correct parameters:Let me try with the lists formatted differently:Let me try without the quotes around the list:Let me check all available tools to see if there's a better approach:Let me try a different approach. I'll first get the full protein entries to understand what information is available, then search for features specifically. Let me start by getting basic protein information:Perfect! I can see that the protein P69905 (Hemoglobin subunit alpha) has several CARBOHYD features in the PTM category. Now let me get the information for the second protein P68871:Excellent! Now I have detailed information from both proteins. Let me create a summary of the glycosylation-related protein sequence features found in these human hemoglobin proteins.

Based on the comprehensive UniProt data retrieved for both hemoglobin proteins, here are the glycosylation-related protein sequence features identified:

## **P69905 (Hemoglobin subunit alpha)**

**Glycosylation Features (CARBOHYD type in PTM category):**

1. **Position 8 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine - alternative modification
   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733
   - Note: This position can also undergo N6-succinyllysine modification

2. **Position 17 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine - alternative modification  
   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733
   - Note: This position can also undergo N6-acetyllysine or N6-succinyllysine modifications

3. **Position 41 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine - alternative modification
   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733
   - Note: This position can also undergo N6-succinyllysine modification

4. **Position 62 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine
   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733

**Additional glycation-related sites:** Several positions (12, 57, 61, 91, 100) are specifically annotated as "Not glycated" based on experimental evidence.

## **P68871 (Hemoglobin subunit beta)**

**Glycosylation Features (CARBOHYD type in PTM category):**

1. **Position 2 (Valine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) valine - in Hb A1c
   - Evidence: PubMed:635569
   - Note: This is the well-known HbA1c glycation site used clinically for diabetes monitoring

2. **Position 9 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine
   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733

3. **Position 18 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine
   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733

4. **Position 67 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine
   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733

5. **Position 121 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine
   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733

6. **Position 145 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine - alternative modification
   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733
   - Note: This position can also undergo N6-acetyllysine modification

**Additional glycation-related sites:** Several positions (60, 83, 96) are specifically annotated as "Not glycated" based on experimental evidence.

## **Summary**

Both reviewed human hemoglobin proteins contain multiple glycosylation sites, predominantly involving non-enzymatic glycation (glucose attachment) to lysine residues and the N-terminal valine of the beta chain. The most clinically significant is the HbA1c glycation site at position 2 of the beta chain, which serves as a biomarker for long-term glucose control in diabetes. These glycation modifications occur slowly and continuously throughout the 120-day lifespan of red blood cells, with rates increased in diabetic patients.
