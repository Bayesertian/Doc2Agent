  "question": "What protein sequence features related to glycosylation can be identified in reviewed proteins of human hemoglobin (Homo sapiens) using the UniProt accession numbers P69905 and P68871? Consider only features categorized under POST_TRANSLATIONAL_MODIFICATIONS and types inclusive of CARBOHYD.",
  "expected_trajectory": "search_protein_sequence_features",
  "expected_answer": "The output should include protein sequence features specifically for the reviewed human hemoglobin proteins (accessions: P69905 and P68871), categorized under POST_TRANSLATIONAL_MODIFICATIONS, with a focus on the CARBOHYD type. The information should highlight the positions of glycosylation sites, types of carbohydrate modifications, and relevant feature descriptions.",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll search for glycosylation-related protein sequence features in the human hemoglobin proteins you specified. Let me query the UniProt database for both accession numbers to find post-translational modifications related to carbohydrates.Let me correct the parameter format and try again:Let me check the function documentation to understand the correct parameter format:I see the issue. The categories should use \"PTM\" instead of \"POST_TRANSLATIONAL_MODIFICATIONS\". Let me try with the correct parameters:Let me try with the lists formatted differently:Let me try without the quotes around the list:Let me check all available tools to see if there's a better approach:Let me try a different approach. I'll first get the full protein entries to understand what information is available, then search for features specifically. Let me start by getting basic protein information:Perfect! I can see that the protein P69905 (Hemoglobin subunit alpha) has several CARBOHYD features in the PTM category. Now let me get the information for the second protein P68871:Excellent! Now I have detailed information from both proteins. Let me create a summary of the glycosylation-related protein sequence features found in these human hemoglobin proteins.\n\nBased on the comprehensive UniProt data retrieved for both hemoglobin proteins, here are the glycosylation-related protein sequence features identified:\n\n## **P69905 (Hemoglobin subunit alpha)**\n\n**Glycosylation Features (CARBOHYD type in PTM category):**\n\n1. **Position 8 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine - alternative modification\n   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733\n   - Note: This position can also undergo N6-succinyllysine modification\n\n2. **Position 17 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine - alternative modification  \n   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733\n   - Note: This position can also undergo N6-acetyllysine or N6-succinyllysine modifications\n\n3. **Position 41 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine - alternative modification\n   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733\n   - Note: This position can also undergo N6-succinyllysine modification\n\n4. **Position 62 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine\n   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733\n\n**Additional glycation-related sites:** Several positions (12, 57, 61, 91, 100) are specifically annotated as \"Not glycated\" based on experimental evidence.\n\n## **P68871 (Hemoglobin subunit beta)**\n\n**Glycosylation Features (CARBOHYD type in PTM category):**\n\n1. **Position 2 (Valine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) valine - in Hb A1c\n   - Evidence: PubMed:635569\n   - Note: This is the well-known HbA1c glycation site used clinically for diabetes monitoring\n\n2. **Position 9 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine\n   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733\n\n3. **Position 18 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine\n   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733\n\n4. **Position 67 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine\n   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733\n\n5. **Position 121 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine\n   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733\n\n6. **Position 145 (Lysine)**: N-linked (Glc) (glycation) lysine - alternative modification\n   - Evidence: PubMed:7358733\n   - Note: This position can also undergo N6-acetyllysine modification\n\n**Additional glycation-related sites:** Several positions (60, 83, 96) are specifically annotated as \"Not glycated\" based on experimental evidence.\n\n## **Summary**\n\nBoth reviewed human hemoglobin proteins contain multiple glycosylation sites, predominantly involving non-enzymatic glycation (glucose attachment) to lysine residues and the N-terminal valine of the beta chain. The most clinically significant is the HbA1c glycation site at position 2 of the beta chain, which serves as a biomarker for long-term glucose control in diabetes. These glycation modifications occur slowly and continuously throughout the 120-day lifespan of red blood cells, with rates increased in diabetic patients.",
