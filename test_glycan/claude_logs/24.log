## Summary of Key Findings

### 1. Post-Translational Modification Patterns
- **Hemoglobin Alpha**: Extensive phosphorylation (11 sites) and lysine modifications (acetylation/succinylation)
- **Hemoglobin Beta**: Moderate phosphorylation (5 sites), unique S-nitrosylation, aspirin-induced acetylation
- **Insulin**: Limited to essential disulfide bond formation for structural integrity

### 2. Carbohydrate-Related Modifications
- **Hemoglobin Alpha**: 4 glycation sites, with Lys-62 being constitutively glycated
- **Hemoglobin Beta**: 6 glycation sites, with Val-2 forming clinically important HbA1c
- **Insulin**: No glycosylation sites; functions through protein-protein interactions

### 3. Clinical Significance
- **HbA1c formation**: Val-2 glycation in beta-globin serves as diabetes monitoring biomarker
- **Drug interactions**: Aspirin acetylation of hemoglobin lysines
- **Insulin variants**: Disulfide bond disruption causes diabetes mellitus
- **Oxygen regulation**: S-nitrosylation of Cys-94 in beta-globin affects O2 transport

### 4. Functional CHAIN Features Present
All three proteins contain essential CHAIN features:
- **Hemoglobin Alpha**: PRO_0000052653 (main chain)
- **Hemoglobin Beta**: PRO_0000052976 (main chain)

This analysis demonstrates that while hemoglobin subunits undergo extensive PTMs including clinically relevant glycation, insulin's modifications are primarily limited to essential disulfide bond formation for proper folding and function.
