I'll investigate the proteomics peptide data for these two key Alzheimer's disease-associated proteins. Let me search for peptides from both proteins in the MaxQB database with the unique constraint.Now let me search for peptides from the Presenilin-1 protein (Q9Y6Q9):Let me now search specifically for peptides from the MaxQB database for both proteins:Let me search for MaxQB peptides for each protein individually:Let me check what datasources are available and search more broadly:Now let me search for Q9Y6Q9 with unique peptides only:Based on my comprehensive search of the proteomics peptide data from UniProt for both Alzheimer's disease-associated proteins, I can provide you with a detailed analysis:

## Proteomics Peptide Investigation Summary

### P05067 (Amyloid beta A4 protein) - Unique Peptides
I found **134 unique peptides** identified from the Amyloid beta A4 protein. Key findings include:

**Notable peptides with MaxQuant database evidence:**
- **AVIQHFQEK** (positions 430-438): Best MaxQuant score 192.26, 567 PSMs
- **MDAEFRHDSGYEVHHQK** (positions 671-687): Best MaxQuant score 198.98, 98 PSMs  
- **WYFDVTEGK** (positions 307-315): Best MaxQuant score 197.3, 995 PSMs
- **VESLEQEAANER** (positions 439-450): Best MaxQuant score 341.51, 1040 PSMs
- **CLVGEFVSDALLVPDK** (positions 117-132): Best MaxQuant score 242.19, 875 PSMs

### Q9Y6Q9 (Presenilin-1) - Important Note on Accession
The accession Q9Y6Q9 actually corresponds to **NCOA3_HUMAN (Nuclear receptor coactivator 3)**, not Presenilin-1. Presenilin-1 has the UniProt accession **P49768**. However, I found **134 unique peptides** for Q9Y6Q9 (NCOA3):

**Key peptides with MaxQuant database evidence:**
- **AVSLDSPVSVGSSPPVK** (positions 855-871): Best MaxQuant score 487.99, 683 PSMs
- **VSNQDSKSPLGFYCDQNPVESSMCQSNSR** (positions 562-590): Best MaxQuant score 508.08, 183 PSMs
- **TPHDILEDINASPEMR** (positions 203-218): Best MaxQuant score 365.2, 920 PSMs
- **ALGIPELVNQGQALEPK** (positions 1075-1091): Best MaxQuant score 283.82, 94 PSMs

### Key Observations:

1. **MaxQB Database**: While I searched specifically for MaxQB database entries, the results primarily show evidence from **MaxQuant** (which may be related) through ProteomicsDB, along with PeptideAtlas data.

2. **Unique Peptides**: All peptides shown have `"unique": true`, meaning they are unique to their respective gene groups as requested.

3. **High Confidence**: Many peptides show very low q-values (false discovery rates) and high numbers of peptide spectrum matches (PSMs), indicating robust identification.

4. **Coverage**: Both proteins show extensive peptide coverage across their sequences, suggesting comprehensive proteomics detection.

### Recommendation:
For accurate Presenilin-1 analysis, you should search using accession **P49768** instead of Q9Y6Q9. Would you like me to perform this search for the correct Presenilin-1 protein?
