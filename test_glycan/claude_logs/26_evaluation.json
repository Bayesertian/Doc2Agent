This suggests that phosphorylation of human PGK1 may be less commonly detected or reported in the analyzed datasets with Gold confidence criteria.\n\n**Detected PTMs with Gold confidence:**\n- **Ubiquitinylation**: Multiple sites (K11, K30, K48, K75, K87)\n- **Acetylation**: Multiple sites (K11, K30, K48, K75)\n- **Limited phosphorylation data** in the specific filtered results\n\n### Mouse PGK1 (P52480) - Note: This is actually Pyruvate Kinase (KPYM_MOUSE)\n**Important correction**: The provided accession P52480 corresponds to Pyruvate Kinase M1/M2 (KPYM), not PGK1. However, the analysis reveals significant phosphorylation patterns:\n\n**Identified Phosphorylation Sites:**\n1. **T50** in peptide NTGIICTIGPASR (position 7 in peptide)\n2. **S100** in peptide EATESFASDPILYR (position 8 in peptide)\n3. **S127** in peptide GSGTAEVELK (position 2 in peptide)\n4. **Y148** in peptide ITLDNAYMEK (position 7 in peptide)\n5. **Y175** in peptide IYVDDGLISLQVK (position 2 in peptide)\n6. **Y370** in peptide GDYPLEAVR (position 3 in peptide)\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### Phosphorylation Patterns in Mouse Pyruvate Kinase (P52480)\n\n#### 1. Threonine Phosphorylation (T50)\n- **Peptide**: NTGIICTIGPASR\n- **Tissue Distribution**: Spleen, Eyes\n- **Confidence**: High (site probability >0.98)\n- **Datasets**: PXD004644, PXD030983\n\n#### 2.

Tyrosine Phosphorylation (Y175)\n- **Peptide**: IYVDDGLISLQVK\n- **Tissue Distribution**: Spleen, Hippocampus, Brain\n- **Confidence**: High (site probability >0.99)\n- **Datasets**: PXD004644, PXD030983, PXD018757\n\n#### 6. Tyrosine Phosphorylation (Y370)\n- **Peptide**: GDYPLEAVR\n- **Tissue Distribution**: Brain, Femur\n- **Confidence**: High (site probability >0.99)\n- **Datasets**: PXD018757, PXD030983\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\n### Species Differences\n1. **Human PGK1**: Limited phosphorylation data retrieved with specified criteria, predominantly shows other PTMs (ubiquitinylation, acetylation)\n2. **Mouse Pyruvate Kinase**: Extensive phosphorylation detected across multiple sites with high confidence\n\n### Tissue Distribution Patterns\n- **Brain tissue**: Most frequently represented in mouse phosphorylation data\n- **Multiple organ systems**: Suggests broad physiological relevance\n- **Embryonic tissues**: Indicates developmental importance\n\n### Phosphorylation Site Types\n- **Serine/Threonine**: Classical kinase targets\n- **Tyrosine**: Suggests involvement in signaling pathways\n- **Multiple sites**: Indicates complex regulatory mechanisms\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Data Quality\n- **Gold confidence scores**: High reliability of identifications\n- **Multiple datasets**: Cross-validation across studies\n- **Tissue diversity**: Broad biological coverage\n\n### Limitations\n1. **Species difference**: P52480 is pyruvate kinase, not PGK1\n2. **Human PGK1 data**: Limited phosphorylation detection with current filters\n3. **Methodological variations**: Different experimental conditions across datasets\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Verify correct PGK1 accession** for mouse (should be P09411)\n2. **Expand search criteria** for human PGK1 phosphorylation\n3. **Cross-reference** with additional databases\n4. **Validate findings** through experimental approaches\n\n## Data Sources\n- **PRIDE Database**: Proteomics Identifications Database\n- **PTMeXchange**: Post-translational Modification Exchange\n- **UniProt**: Universal Protein Resource\n- **Confidence Level**: Gold standard identifications only\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis analysis reveals significant differences in phosphorylation patterns between the queried proteins. The mouse data (P52480 - Pyruvate Kinase) shows extensive phosphorylation across multiple sites and tissues, while human PGK1 data retrieved under these specific criteria shows limited phosphorylation evidence. Future investigations should focus on obtaining correct mouse PGK1 data and expanding search parameters for comprehensive comparative analysis.\n\nBased on my analysis of the PTM data, I found an important discrepancy that needs to be addressed. The analysis reveals:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n**1. Data Accuracy Issue:**\n- The mouse accession P52480 you provided actually corresponds to **Pyruvate Kinase M1/M2 (KPYM_MOUSE)**, not PGK1\n- The correct mouse PGK1 accession should be **P09411**\n\n**2. Human PGK1 (P00558):**\n- Retrieved data primarily showed **ubiquitinylation and acetylation** modifications\n- Limited phosphorylation data was detected with the Gold confidence criteria\n- Multiple ubiquitination sites detected at K11, K30, K48, K75, K87\n- Acetylation detected at similar lysine residues\n\n**3. Mouse Pyruvate Kinase (P52480):**\n- Extensive phosphorylation detected across **6 major sites**:\n  - T50, S100, S127, Y148, Y175, Y370\n- High confidence identifications (>0.88 site probability)\n- Broad tissue distribution (brain, spleen, embryonic tissues, etc.)\n- Multiple datasets supporting findings\n\n## Recommendations:\n\n1. **Verify the correct mouse PGK1 accession** (likely P09411)\n2. **Re-run the analysis** with the correct mouse PGK1 protein\n3. **Expand search criteria** for human PGK1 to capture phosphorylation events that might not meet Gold confidence thresholds\n4. **Consider additional databases** beyond PRIDE and PTMeXchange\n\nWould you like me to re-run the analysis with the correct mouse PGK1 accession (P09411) to provide a proper comparative study of phosphorylation modifications between human and mouse PGK1?",
