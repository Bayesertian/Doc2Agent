I'll help you identify KEGG compound database entries for flavonoids with an exact molecular mass of 286.2 g/mol. Let me search the database systematically.Now let me get detailed information about these flavonoid entries to check their molecular masses:Let me search for them individually:These are generic compounds without specific molecular formulas. Let me search more broadly for compounds with molecular mass around 286.2 g/mol:Let me search more specifically for common flavonoids that might have a molecular mass of 286.2 g/mol:Now let me check the molecular formula/mass of kaempferol specifically:Excellent! Kaempferol (C05903) has an exact mass of 286.0477 and molecular weight of 286.24 g/mol, which matches your criteria. Let me search for other flavonoids that might have similar masses:Perfect! Luteolin (C01514) also has the same exact mass of 286.0477 and molecular weight of 286.24 g/mol. Let me search for more flavonoids with this molecular formula C15H10O6:Let me try searching for other common flavonoids that might have this molecular formula:Excellent! Fisetin (C10041) also has the same molecular formula and mass. Let me search for more flavonoids:Quercetin has a different molecular formula (C15H10O7) and mass (302.0427), so it doesn't match our criteria. Let me search for more flavones and flavonols:Apigenin has a different molecular formula (C15H10O5) and mass (270.0528), so it doesn't match our criteria either.

Based on my search of the KEGG compound database, I have identified **three flavonoids with an exact molecular mass of 286.2 g/mol** (more precisely 286.0477 Da):

## KEGG Compound Database Entries for Flavonoids with Molecular Mass 286.2 g/mol:

### 1. **Kaempferol (C05903)**
- **Formula**: C15H10O6
- **Exact Mass**: 286.0477 Da
- **Molecular Weight**: 286.24 g/mol
- **Classification**: Flavonol
- **Alternative Names**: 3,4',5,7-Tetrahydroxyflavone; 5,7,4'-Trihydroxyflavonol
- **Biological Activities**: Involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathways; has antioxidant properties

### 2. **Luteolin (C01514)**
- **Formula**: C15H10O6  
- **Exact Mass**: 286.0477 Da
- **Molecular Weight**: 286.24 g/mol
- **Classification**: Flavone
- **Alternative Names**: 3',4',5,7-Tetrahydroxyflavone; 5,7,3',4'-Tetrahydroxyflavone
- **Biological Activities**: Participates in flavonoid biosynthesis and degradation pathways; exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties

### 3. **Fisetin (C10041)**
- **Formula**: C15H10O6
- **Exact Mass**: 286.0477 Da
- **Molecular Weight**: 286.24 g/mol
- **Classification**: Flavonol
- **Alternative Names**: 7,3',4'-Trihydroxyflavonol
- **Biological Activities**: Known for its antioxidant and neuroprotective properties

All three compounds share the same molecular formula (C15H10O6) and exact mass, representing different structural isomers of tetrahydroxyflavones. They are all involved in plant secondary metabolism and have documented biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and potential therapeutic properties.

Note: While you mentioned exploring "glycans," these compounds are actually flavonoids (polyphenolic compounds) rather than glycans (carbohydrates). However, flavonoids can exist as glycosides when bound to sugar moieties, which would increase their molecular mass beyond 286.2 g/mol.
