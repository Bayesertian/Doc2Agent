  "question": "How many reviewed UniProt entries exist for the protein 'Glycosyltransferase' in the organism 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae' (taxid 559292), with a sequence length between 400 and 800 amino acids and associated with the Gene Ontology term 'GO:0005975' (carbohydrate metabolic process)?",
  "expected_trajectory": "search_uniprot_entries",
  "expected_answer": "The response will return the number of reviewed protein entries matching these criteria: protein name contains 'Glycosyltransferase', organism 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae' (taxid 559292), with sequence lengths between 400-800 amino acids, and the GO term 'GO:0005975'. Each entry will include details such as protein accession numbers, names, sequence lengths, and associated GO terms.",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll help you find the reviewed UniProt entries for glycosyltransferase proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with your specific criteria. Let me search the UniProt database with these parameters.I see there's an issue with the sequence length format. Let me correct that and use the proper range format:The search returned an empty result set, which means there are **0 reviewed UniProt entries** that match all your specific criteria:\n\n- Protein name containing \"Glycosyltransferase\"\n- Organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (taxid 559292)\n- Reviewed status: true (Swiss-Prot entries only)\n- Sequence length: 400-800 amino acids\n- Associated with GO term GO:0005975 (carbohydrate metabolic process)\n\nThis could be due to several reasons:\n1. The combination of all these specific criteria is very restrictive\n2. Glycosyltransferases in S. cerevisiae might not fall within the 400-800 amino acid range\n3. They might not all be annotated with the specific GO term GO:0005975\n4. Some entries might be unreviewed (TrEMBL) rather than reviewed (Swiss-Prot)\n\nWould you like me to search with relaxed criteria to see what glycosyltransferases are available in S. cerevisiae, or would you prefer to modify any of the search parameters?",

    "reasoning": "The agent did not successfully complete the research task as it failed to retrieve any reviewed UniProt entries for the specified criteria. The agent's response indicated an empty result set, which suggests that the search parameters might have been too restrictive or incorrectly applied. The agent did not provide any specific details about the search process, such as the exact query used or any intermediate results, which makes it difficult to assess whether the search was conducted correctly. Additionally, the agent did not attempt to verify or adjust the search parameters to ensure accuracy, nor did it provide any alternative strategies to address potential issues with the search criteria.",
