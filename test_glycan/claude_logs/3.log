I'll retrieve the molecular formula, molecular weight, and InChIKey properties for the compounds with PubChem IDs 2244, 5957, and 7629 using the PubChem database.Here are the molecular properties for the three PubChem compounds:

**PubChem CID 2244:**
- **Molecular Formula:** C₉H₈O₄
- **Molecular Weight:** 180.16 g/mol
- **InChIKey:** BSYNRYMUTXBXSQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N

**PubChem CID 5957:**
- **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₆N₅O₁₃P₃
- **Molecular Weight:** 507.18 g/mol
- **InChIKey:** ZKHQWZAMYRWXGA-KQYNXXCUSA-N

**PubChem CID 7629:**
- **Molecular Formula:** C₆H₅Hg⁺
- **Molecular Weight:** 277.70 g/mol
- **InChIKey:** BODKAQWWZBLGOU-UHFFFAOYSA-N

These compounds show interesting structural diversity relevant to biochemical pathways. CID 5957 appears to be a nucleotide or nucleotide-related compound based on its molecular formula containing multiple phosphate groups and nitrogen atoms, which could indeed be relevant to glycan-related biochemical processes. CID 2244 has a simpler organic structure, while CID 7629 contains mercury, suggesting it might be an organometallic compound used in research applications.
