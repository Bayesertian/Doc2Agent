I'll help you investigate the natural variants in those UniProt proteins with the specific criteria you've outlined. Let me search for natural variants that match your parameters.Let me also search for stop-gained mutations and try with ClinVar as the source:Now let me search for the specific dbSNP ID you mentioned:The search results show that rs121918508 is associated with protein P21802 (FGFR2_HUMAN), not the accessions you specified (P12345 and Q67890). Let me verify if these accessions exist and get more information:Now let me perform a broader search to see if there are any variants that match the specific criteria, without being limited to these exact accessions:Based on my investigation of the natural variants in UniProt proteins P12345 and Q67890, along with the search for the specific dbSNP ID rs121918508, I need to provide you with some important clarifications about your query:

## Key Findings:

### **Protein Accession Issues:**
1. **P12345** - This is not a human protein. It's actually the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, not a human protein related to Alzheimer's disease.

2. **Q67890** - This is a Hepatitis B virus protein (Large envelope protein), not a human protein.

### **Actual Variant Data for rs121918508:**
The dbSNP ID rs121918508 you specified is indeed a real variant, but it's found in **human FGFR2 proteins** (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2), specifically:

- **Primary protein**: P21802 (FGFR2_HUMAN)
- **Genomic location**: Chromosome 10q26.13
- **Variant type**: Missense mutations at position 648 (in P21802)
- **Wild-type amino acid**: Alanine (A)
- **Alternative sequences**: Threonine (T), Proline (P), or Serine (S)

### **Disease Associations:**
This variant is associated with:
- **Lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital syndrome 1 (LADD1)** - OMIM:149730
- **FGFR2-related craniosynostosis**
- **Familial scaphocephaly syndrome, McGillivray type** - OMIM:609579
- **Levy-Hollister syndrome (LADD)**

### **Clinical Significance:**
- **Pathogenic** - confirmed by multiple sources (ClinVar, UniProt, Ensembl)
- **Very rare variant** - allele frequency of 6.84e-7 in gnomAD
- **Cross-referenced** in ClinVar, dbSNP, and multiple other databases

## **Important Notes:**
1. **No Alzheimer's Disease 1 association** - This variant is not associated with Alzheimer's disease but rather with developmental syndromes affecting craniofacial development.

2. **Position criteria not met** - The variant occurs at position 648, which is outside your specified range of positions 10-60.

3. **Alternative sequence criteria** - While you specified Valine (V) or deletion (-), the actual alternatives for this SNP are Threonine (T), Proline (P), and Serine (S).

It appears there may be some confusion in your query parameters. If you're specifically interested in Alzheimer's disease-associated variants, you might want to look at different proteins like APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2, or provide different UniProt accessions for human proteins actually associated with Alzheimer's disease.
