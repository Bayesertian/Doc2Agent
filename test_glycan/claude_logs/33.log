## Summary of Results

**3 Partial Matches Found:**
1. **G48061MK** - Exact match with unknown anomeric configuration
2. **G51197ZR** - Near-identical with defined β-glucose at reducing end  
3. **G44161QY** - Extended structure with sialylation

## Most Significant Novel Features

**Sialylation Extension (G44161QY):** The most striking novel feature is the addition of N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) linked α2→6, which:
- Doubles the molecular complexity (9 residues vs 5)
- Introduces negative charge
- Creates potential for enhanced biological recognition
- Suggests tissue-specific or disease-related expression

**Anomeric Configuration Differences:** The variation between unknown (x) and defined β-anomers at the reducing end indicates potential enzymatic specificity differences.

## Structural Relationships

All structures share a common **pentasaccharide core** with consistent N-acetylation patterns, suggesting this represents a fundamental biological building block. The G44161QY structure appears to be a decorated version of the base structure, indicating a possible biosynthetic pathway where the core structure is elaborated through additional enzymatic modifications.

The analysis reveals these glycans likely represent a functionally related family involved in cell surface recognition, with the sialylated variant potentially serving specialized roles in immune signaling or pathological processes.
