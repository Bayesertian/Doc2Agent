I'll help you convert that WURCS notation to a GlyTouCan ID and generate an image for publication use. Let me work through this step by step using the available glycan databases.Great! The GlyTouCan ID for your WURCS notation is **G22768VO**. Now let me generate a high-quality image suitable for publication:Perfect! I've successfully obtained both the GlyTouCan ID and generated a publication-ready image for your glycan structure.

## Summary:

**GlyTouCan ID:** `G22768VO`

**WURCS Notation:** `WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1`

**Generated Image:** The system has generated a high-quality PNG image in base64 format that you can use directly in publications.

## For Publication Use:

1. **Citation Reference:** You can reference this glycan structure using the GlyTouCan ID `G22768VO` in your manuscript, which provides a stable, permanent identifier that readers can use to access the structure in the GlyTouCan database.

2. **Image Usage:** The generated image is in PNG format and suitable for inclusion in scientific publications. The image shows the standard symbolic representation of the glycan structure following established conventions.

3. **Database Links:** Readers can access detailed information about this glycan structure at: `https://glytoucan.org/Structures/Glycans/G22768VO`

This workflow demonstrates how WURCS notation serves as a bridge between computational glycan representation and visual communication in scientific literature, allowing for both machine-readable data exchange and human-interpretable structural diagrams.
