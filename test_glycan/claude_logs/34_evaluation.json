  "expected_trajectory": "obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs -> generate_glycan_image",
  "expected_answer": "The GlyTouCan ID corresponding to the provided WURCS notation will be returned, followed by a generated image of the glycan structure in PNG format. The result will include the GlyTouCan ID and a graphical representation of the structure.",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll help you convert that WURCS notation to a GlyTouCan ID and generate an image for publication use. Let me work through this step by step using the available glycan databases.Great! The GlyTouCan ID for your WURCS notation is **G22768VO**. Now let me generate a high-quality image suitable for publication:Perfect! I've successfully obtained both the GlyTouCan ID and generated a publication-ready image for your glycan structure.\n\n## Summary:\n\n**GlyTouCan ID:** `G22768VO`\n\n**WURCS Notation:** `WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1`\n\n**Generated Image:** The system has generated a high-quality PNG image in base64 format that you can use directly in publications.\n\n## For Publication Use:\n\n1. **Citation Reference:** You can reference this glycan structure using the GlyTouCan ID `G22768VO` in your manuscript, which provides a stable, permanent identifier that readers can use to access the structure in the GlyTouCan database.\n\n2. **Image Usage:** The generated image is in PNG format and suitable for inclusion in scientific publications. The image shows the standard symbolic representation of the glycan structure following established conventions.\n\n3. **Database Links:** Readers can access detailed information about this glycan structure at: `https://glytoucan.org/Structures/Glycans/G22768VO`\n\nThis workflow demonstrates how WURCS notation serves as a bridge between computational glycan representation and visual communication in scientific literature, allowing for both machine-readable data exchange and human-interpretable structural diagrams.",

    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by obtaining the GlyTouCan ID corresponding to the provided WURCS notation and generating an image of the glycan structure. The agent's approach aligns with the expected API trajectory, as it effectively converted the WURCS notation to a GlyTouCan ID and then generated a glycan image. The agent provided a comprehensive summary that included the GlyTouCan ID, the WURCS notation, and a description of the generated image, which is suitable for publication use. The agent also included a citation reference and a link to the GlyTouCan database, which are valuable for scientific communication and verification.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is high. The agent correctly interpreted the WURCS notation and successfully retrieved the corresponding GlyTouCan ID, which is a critical step in glycomics research for identifying and referencing glycan structures. The generation of a publication-ready image further demonstrates the agent's understanding of the importance of visual representation in scientific literature.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used appropriate tools and followed a logical workflow. It started with converting the WURCS notation to a GlyTouCan ID, which is a necessary step for accessing detailed glycan information. The subsequent generation of a glycan image indicates that the agent effectively integrated the results from different API calls. The workflow progression was logical, and the agent provided meaningful synthesis of the results, demonstrating a good understanding of glycomics best practices.",
