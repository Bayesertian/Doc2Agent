  "question": "Considering the glycan structure represented in WURCS format 'WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1', generate a visual image of the glycan and then validate the WURCS notation for accuracy. The research task is aligned towards creating reliable visual datasets of glycan structures that are validated as per scientific standards. Use 'generate_glycan_image' to create an image in 'png' format with 'html' response type and use 'validate_wurcs' to ensure the WURCS notation is correctly formatted and free of errors.",
  "expected_trajectory": "generate_glycan_image -> validate_wurcs",
  "expected_answer": "1. Glycan structure image in 'png' format returned by 'generate_glycan_image'. 2. Validation results from 'validate_wurcs', indicating if there are any errors or warnings in the WURCS notation.",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll help you generate a visual image of the glycan structure and validate the WURCS notation. Let me start by generating the glycan image and then validate the WURCS format.Let me try the validation first to check the WURCS notation:Excellent! The WURCS validation is successful. Now let me try the image generation again with different parameters:It appears there's a technical issue with the image generation service. However, I can provide you with the validation results and analysis of the glycan structure.\n\n## WURCS Validation Results\n\n\u2705 **VALIDATION SUCCESSFUL**\n\nThe WURCS notation `WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1` has been validated and is **completely accurate** with:\n\n- **No Errors**: The notation is correctly formatted\n- **No Warnings**: All structural elements are properly defined\n- **No Unverifiable Elements**: All components can be verified\n\n## Structural Analysis\n\nBased on the WURCS notation, this glycan structure contains:\n\n**Monosaccharide Composition (3 unique residue types, 5 total residues):**\n1. `[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O]` - N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) with \u03b2-linkage\n2. `[a1122h-1b_1-5]` - Glucose (Glc) with \u03b2-linkage  \n3. `[a1122h-1a_1-5]` - Glucose (Glc) with \u03b1-linkage\n\n**Linkage Pattern (4 glycosidic bonds):**\n- The structure shows a branched pentasaccharide with specific linkage positions:\n  - \u03b21-4 linkages\n  - \u03b21-3 linkages  \n  - \u03b21-6 linkages\n\n## Recommendation for Image Generation\n\nWhile the image generation service encountered a technical issue, the WURCS notation is scientifically valid and ready for use in creating reliable visual datasets. You may want to:\n\n1. Try the image generation service again later when the technical issue is resolved\n2. Use alternative glycan visualization tools with this validated WURCS string\n3. Convert this WURCS to other formats (like GlycoCT) for visualization in different platforms\n\nThe validation confirms this WURCS notation meets scientific standards and can be confidently used for research purposes involving glycan structure datasets.",
