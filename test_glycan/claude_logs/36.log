I'll help you convert the GWS formatted glycan to WURCS format and then obtain the GlyTouCan ID. Let me do this step by step.

First, let me convert the GWS format to WURCS:Great! The GWS format has been successfully converted to WURCS format:
**WURCS**: `WURCS=2.0/3,4,3/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a2112h-1b_1-5][a2122h-1b_1-5]/1-2-3-1/a3-b1_b4-c1_c6-d1`

Now let me obtain the GlyTouCan ID for this WURCS format:The conversion was successful, but it appears this particular glycan structure doesn't have a registered GlyTouCan ID in the database yet. This is indicated by the "Accession not found" message.

## Summary:

**Original GWS Format**: 
`freeEnd--?b1D-GlcNAc,p--3b1D-Gal,p--4b1D-Glc,p--6b1D-GlcNAc,p$MONO,Und,0,0,freeEnd`

**Converted WURCS Format**: 
`WURCS=2.0/3,4,3/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a2112h-1b_1-5][a2122h-1b_1-5]/1-2-3-1/a3-b1_b4-c1_c6-d1`

**GlyTouCan ID**: Not found in the database

**Additional Information**: The API also provided the GlycoCT representation of this glycan structure, which describes a tetrasaccharide containing N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and glucose residues with specific linkages.

The WURCS format conversion was successful, but this particular glycan structure hasn't been registered in the GlyTouCan database yet, which is why no accession ID was returned.
