I'll help you validate the WURCS glycan structure and obtain its GlyTouCan ID. Let me execute this step by step.

## Step 1: Validating the WURCS structureExcellent! The WURCS validation was successful with no errors, warnings, or unverifiable elements.

## Step 2: Obtaining the GlyTouCan ID

Now I'll retrieve the GlyTouCan ID for this validated WURCS structure:Let me try the GlyTouCan ID retrieval again:## Results Summary

**Step 1 - WURCS Validation: ✅ SUCCESSFUL**
- The WURCS string `WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1` is valid
- No errors, warnings, or unverifiable elements were found
- The structure is correctly formatted and can be processed further

**Step 2 - GlyTouCan ID Retrieval: ❌ UNAVAILABLE**
- The GlyTouCan ID lookup function encountered a technical issue and could not return results
- This may indicate that either:
  - The glycan structure is not registered in the GlyTouCan database, or
  - There's a temporary service issue with the GlyTouCan API

**Conclusion:**
The WURCS structure has been successfully validated and is structurally correct. However, I was unable to retrieve the corresponding GlyTouCan ID due to a service issue. The validated WURCS represents a pentasaccharide structure with N-acetylglucosamine modifications, but you may need to try the GlyTouCan lookup again later or check if this particular structure is registered in the GlyTouCan database.
