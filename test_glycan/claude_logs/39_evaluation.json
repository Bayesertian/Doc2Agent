  "question": "In this research task, we aim to validate a glycan structure in WURCS format and subsequently obtain its corresponding GlyTouCan ID. The specific glycan to be tested is given in WURCS format as `WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1`. \n\nThe task involves:\n1. Validating the provided WURCS string using the `validate_wurcs` function to ensure that it is correctly formatted and free of errors or warnings.\n2. Upon successful validation (i.e., no critical errors), using the `obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs` function to retrieve the GlyTouCan ID for the validated structure.\n\nYour task is to execute these steps sequentially and report any validation results as well as the final GlyTouCan ID if available.",
  "expected_trajectory": "validate_wurcs -> obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs",
  "expected_answer": "1. Result of WURCS validation: Including any errors, warnings, or notes on the format standardization.\n2. GlyTouCan ID: The accession number for the glycan structure if it passes validation.",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll help you validate the WURCS glycan structure and obtain its GlyTouCan ID. Let me execute this step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Validating the WURCS structureExcellent! The WURCS validation was successful with no errors, warnings, or unverifiable elements.\n\n## Step 2: Obtaining the GlyTouCan ID\n\nNow I'll retrieve the GlyTouCan ID for this validated WURCS structure:Let me try the GlyTouCan ID retrieval again:## Results Summary\n\n**Step 1 - WURCS Validation: \u2705 SUCCESSFUL**\n- The WURCS string `WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1` is valid\n- No errors, warnings, or unverifiable elements were found\n- The structure is correctly formatted and can be processed further\n\n**Step 2 - GlyTouCan ID Retrieval: \u274c UNAVAILABLE**\n- The GlyTouCan ID lookup function encountered a technical issue and could not return results\n- This may indicate that either:\n  - The glycan structure is not registered in the GlyTouCan database, or\n  - There's a temporary service issue with the GlyTouCan API\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe WURCS structure has been successfully validated and is structurally correct. However, I was unable to retrieve the corresponding GlyTouCan ID due to a service issue. The validated WURCS represents a pentasaccharide structure with N-acetylglucosamine modifications, but you may need to try the GlyTouCan lookup again later or check if this particular structure is registered in the GlyTouCan database.",

While the agent correctly validated the WURCS string, it failed to retrieve the GlyTouCan ID, which was a critical part of the task.
