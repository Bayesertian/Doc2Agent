  "question": "What are the MolecularFormula, MolecularWeight, and InChIKey properties of the compounds with PubChem IDs 2244, 5957, and 7629? This information is crucial for understanding the structural and chemical characteristics of these compounds, which are important in glycan-related biochemical pathways.",
  "expected_trajectory": "compound_property_tables",
  "expected_answer": "The CSV data should include the following details for each compound: MolecularFormula, which provides the elemental composition; MolecularWeight, which gives the compound's mass in Daltons; and InChIKey, a unique identifier for chemical substances. Each compound should be represented in a separate line with these property values.",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll retrieve the molecular formula, molecular weight, and InChIKey properties for the compounds with PubChem IDs 2244, 5957, and 7629 using the PubChem database.Here are the molecular properties for the three PubChem compounds:\n\n**PubChem CID 2244:**\n- **Molecular Formula:** C\u2089H\u2088O\u2084\n- **Molecular Weight:** 180.16 g/mol\n- **InChIKey:** BSYNRYMUTXBXSQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n\n**PubChem CID 5957:**\n- **Molecular Formula:** C\u2081\u2080H\u2081\u2086N\u2085O\u2081\u2083P\u2083\n- **Molecular Weight:** 507.18 g/mol\n- **InChIKey:** ZKHQWZAMYRWXGA-KQYNXXCUSA-N\n\n**PubChem CID 7629:**\n- **Molecular Formula:** C\u2086H\u2085Hg\u207a\n- **Molecular Weight:** 277.70 g/mol\n- **InChIKey:** BODKAQWWZBLGOU-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n\nThese compounds show interesting structural diversity relevant to biochemical pathways. CID 5957 appears to be a nucleotide or nucleotide-related compound based on its molecular formula containing multiple phosphate groups and nitrogen atoms, which could indeed be relevant to glycan-related biochemical processes. CID 2244 has a simpler organic structure, while CID 7629 contains mercury, suggesting it might be an organometallic compound used in research applications.",
