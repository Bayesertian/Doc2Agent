I'll help you retrieve UniParc entries for the RefSeq accession 'XP_006524055' with the specified filters. Let me use the appropriate tool to get this information.It looks like there was a timeout error when trying to retrieve the data from the EBI API. This can happen when the service is temporarily unavailable or experiencing high load. Let me try the request again:Unfortunately, I'm encountering timeout errors when trying to access the EBI UniParc API. This suggests that either:

1. The EBI service is currently experiencing high load or temporary issues
2. The specific query is taking longer than the timeout threshold (50 seconds)
3. There might be network connectivity issues

The query I attempted used the following parameters:
- **dbid**: XP_006524055 (the RefSeq accession you specified)
- **format**: json (to return data in JSON format as requested)
- **rfActive**: true (to only include active cross references)
- **rfDbid**: RefSeq (to filter for RefSeq database entries)
- **rfTaxId**: 9606 (to filter for human taxonomy)

You might want to try this query again later when the EBI service might be more responsive, or you could try accessing the UniParc database directly through the EBI website at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniparc/ to search for this RefSeq accession manually.
