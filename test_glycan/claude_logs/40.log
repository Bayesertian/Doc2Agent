## Introduction

Siglecs are a family of sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins that play crucial roles in immune system regulation. As cell surface receptors primarily expressed on immune cells, they modulate cellular responses through recognition of sialic acid-containing glycans. This investigation explores their involvement in human diseases using curated data from the UniLectin database and detailed protein analysis from UniProt.
