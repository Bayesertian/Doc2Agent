This analysis examines genetic variants that may affect glycosylation patterns and protein function, with emphasis on their clinical significance.\n\n## Protein Structure and Glycosylation Sites\n\n### Basic Information\n- **Gene**: SERPINA1\n- **Protein**: Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT)\n- **UniProt ID**: P01009\n- **Sequence Length**: 418 amino acids (mature protein: residues 25-418)\n- **Location**: Chromosome 14q32.13\n\n### N-Glycosylation Sites\nSERPINA1 contains three confirmed N-linked glycosylation sites:\n\n1. **Asn-70**: N-linked (GlcNAc...) complex type\n   - Structure: Hex5HexNAc4 with di-antennary structure\n   - Some antennae are fucosylated forming Lewis-X determinants\n\n2. **Asn-107**: N-linked (GlcNAc...) complex type\n   - Can be di-antennary, tri-antennary, or tetra-antennary\n   - Variable glycan structure affects protein properties\n\n3. **Asn-271**: N-linked (GlcNAc...) complex type\n   - Exclusively di-antennary structure\n   - Structure: Hex5HexNAc4\n\n### Glycosylation Impact\nThe differential glycosylation produces multiple protein isoforms with varying:\n- Protein stability and folding\n- Secretion efficiency\n- Biological activity\n- Protein-protein interactions\n\n## Critical Variants Affecting Glycosylation\n\n### 1.
