For instance, the UniProt accession P38398 is incorrect for the human BRCA1 protein; the correct accession is P38398 for a different protein. The agent's PTM data, including the number of sites and types of modifications, does not match known data for BRCA1. Additionally, the agent's interpretation of PTM types and their functional significance lacks proper scientific backing and appears speculative without proper references. 3. **Completeness**: The agent did not fully address the research question.
