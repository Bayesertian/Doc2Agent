This protein is a crucial component of the ciliary transition zone and plays a fundamental role in ciliary structure and function.\n\n## Protein Identity and Basic Information\n- **Full Name**: Tectonic-like complex member MKS1\n- **Alternative Name**: Meckel syndrome type 1 protein\n- **Gene**: MKS1\n- **Organism**: Homo sapiens (Human)\n- **Accession**: Q9NXB0 (isoform 3: Q9NXB0-3)\n- **Length**: 559 amino acids (for canonical isoform)\n- **Molecular Weight**: 64,528 Da\n\n## Structural Features and Domains\n\n### Key Functional Domain\nThe protein contains a **C2 B9-type domain** spanning residues 311-439, which is critical for its function. This domain is characteristic of proteins involved in ciliary transition zone organization and represents an evolutionarily conserved structural motif.\n\n### Isoform 3 Characteristics\nIsoform 3 (Q9NXB0-3) differs from the canonical sequence by a variant sequence (VSP_046063) affecting residues 1-26, indicating alternative splicing that may modify the N-terminal region's function.\n\n## Cross-References and Evolutionary Context\n\n### Database Cross-References\nThe protein has extensive cross-references across multiple databases:\n\n**Sequence Databases:**\n- EMBL: Multiple entries (DQ185029, AK000352, AK310815, etc.)\n- RefSeq: NP_060247.2, NM_017777.4\n- CCDS: CCDS11603.2\n\n**Functional Databases:**\n- AlphaFoldDB: Q9NXB0 (3D structure prediction)\n- BioGRID: 120249 (130 interactions)\n- STRING: 9606.ENSP00000376827\n- ComplexPortal: CPX-2531 (MKS transition zone complex)\n\n**Glycosylation Information:**\n- GlyGen: Q9NXB0 (indicates 2 glycosylation sites)\n\n### Evolutionary Lineage\nThe protein belongs to the eukaryotic lineage and shows conservation across:\n- Eukaryota \u2192 Metazoa \u2192 Chordata \u2192 Vertebrata \u2192 Mammalia \u2192 Primates \u2192 Homo\n\n## Functional Implications\n\n### Primary Function\nMKS1 serves as a component of the **tectonic-like complex** (also called B9 complex), which:\n1. Localizes at the ciliary transition zone\n2. Acts as a diffusion barrier preventing transmembrane protein movement between cilia and plasma membranes\n3. Regulates centrosome migration during early ciliogenesis\n4. Controls ciliary length and number through centrosome duplication modulation\n\n### Cellular Localization\n- **Primary**: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, cilium basal body\n- **Secondary**: Centrosome, transition zone (between basal body and ciliary axoneme)\n- **Additional**: Nucleolus, nucleoplasm (suggesting potential nuclear functions)\n\n## Disease Associations and Clinical Relevance\n\n### Associated Ciliopathies\nMutations in MKS1 cause several severe genetic disorders:\n\n1. **Meckel Syndrome 1 (MKS1)** - MIM:249000\n   - Renal cysts, CNS anomalies, hepatic ductal dysplasia, polydactyly\n\n2. **Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 13 (BBS13)** - MIM:615990\n   - Retinopathy, obesity, polydactyly, hypogenitalism, intellectual disability\n\n3. **Joubert Syndrome 28 (JBTS28)** - MIM:617121\n   - Cerebellar ataxia, hypotonia, breathing abnormalities, molar tooth sign\n\n### Significant Variants\nThe protein shows multiple disease-associated variants:\n- **Position 19**: F\u2192Y (no rescue of ciliation defects)\n- **Position 166**: R\u2192W (uncertain significance in MKS1)\n- **Position 317**: D\u2192E (no ciliation defects, normal localization)\n- **Positions 362, 371**: Deletions in JBTS28 and BBS13\n- **Position 403**: F\u2192L (decreased cilia formation)\n- **Position 421**: P\u2192S (partial rescue in knockdown cells)\n\n## Protein Interactions and Complex Formation\n\n### Key Interacting Partners\n1. **TMEM107**: Critical for ciliopathy complex assembly\n2. **TMEM67**: Meckel syndrome protein interaction\n3. **B9D1 and B9D2**: B9 complex components\n4. **FLNA (Filamin A)**: Mediates ciliogenesis\n5. **TCTN1, TCTN2, TCTN3**: Tectonic family proteins\n6. **AHI1, CC2D2A**: Additional ciliopathy proteins\n\n### Complex Assembly\nPart of the **MKS transition zone complex** (CPX-2531), which represents a sophisticated molecular machinery essential for proper ciliary function.\n\n## Post-Translational Modifications\n\n### Glycosylation Status\nAccording to GlyGen database cross-references, MKS1 contains **2 glycosylation sites**. While specific O-GlcNAc modifications couldn't be retrieved due to database connectivity issues, the presence of glycosylation sites suggests potential regulatory mechanisms through post-translational modifications.\n\n### Phosphorylation\nThe protein has been identified in phosphoproteomic studies, indicating potential regulatory phosphorylation events that may modulate its ciliary functions.\n\n## Evolutionary Implications\n\n### Functional Conservation\nThe presence of the C2 B9-type domain across species indicates:\n1. **Ancient evolutionary origin** of ciliary transition zone mechanisms\n2. **Functional constraint** maintaining domain structure across vertebrates\n3. **Specialized role** in metazoan ciliary biology\n\n### Disease Evolution Perspective\nThe association with multiple ciliopathies suggests:\n1. **Pleiotropic effects** of MKS1 dysfunction across organ systems\n2. **Developmental timing** sensitivity to protein function\n3. **Threshold effects** where partial function loss leads to different phenotypes\n\n### Alternative Splicing Evolution\nThe existence of three isoforms (including Q9NXB0-3) indicates:\n1. **Functional diversification** through alternative splicing\n2. **Tissue-specific** or **developmental stage-specific** regulation\n3. **Evolutionary flexibility** in protein function\n\n## Therapeutic and Research Implications\n\n### Drug Development Targets\nUnderstanding MKS1 function provides insights for:\n1. **Ciliopathy therapeutics** targeting transition zone assembly\n2. **Regenerative medicine** approaches for ciliary dysfunction\n3. **Developmental disorder interventions**\n\n### Research Applications\nThe protein serves as a model for:\n1. **Ciliary biology** mechanistic studies\n2. **Transition zone** structural organization research\n3. **Ciliopathy** pathogenesis investigation\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMKS1 represents a evolutionarily conserved and functionally critical component of the ciliary transition zone. Its multiple disease associations, complex interaction network, and post-translational modification potential highlight its central role in ciliary biology. The isoform 3 variant (Q9NXB0-3) with its N-terminal modifications may provide tissue-specific or developmental regulation, demonstrating the sophisticated evolutionary mechanisms that have evolved to fine-tune ciliary function in human development and health.\n\nThe protein's association with multiple severe genetic disorders underscores its clinical importance, while its conservation across species emphasizes its fundamental biological significance in eukaryotic cell biology and development.\nI've provided a comprehensive analysis of the MKS1 protein encoded by UniProt accession Q9NXB0-3, covering its evolutionary implications and functional modifications. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Summary of Key Points:\n\n**Evolutionary Significance:**\n- MKS1 contains a highly conserved C2 B9-type domain (residues 311-439) that's essential for ciliary transition zone function\n- The protein shows conservation across the eukaryotic lineage, particularly in metazoans\n- Three isoforms exist, including Q9NXB0-3 with N-terminal modifications, suggesting evolutionary fine-tuning\n\n**Functional Modifications:**\n- **Glycosylation**: 2 documented glycosylation sites (though specific O-GlcNAc data wasn't accessible)\n- **Phosphorylation**: Identified in phosphoproteomic studies\n- **Alternative splicing**: Isoform 3 has modified N-terminus (VSP_046063, residues 1-26)\n\n**Cross-References Found:**\n- Multiple sequence databases (EMBL, RefSeq, CCDS)\n- Interaction databases (BioGRID: 130 interactions, STRING)\n- Glycosylation database (GlyGen: 2 sites)\n- Complex database (ComplexPortal: MKS transition zone complex)\n\n**Clinical Relevance:**\nThe protein is associated with three major ciliopathies (Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and Joubert syndrome), with numerous disease-causing variants identified throughout the sequence.\n\n**Functional Context:**\nMKS1 is part of the tectonic-like complex that acts as a critical barrier at the ciliary transition zone, regulating protein trafficking between the cytoplasm and ciliary compartment.\n\nWhile I couldn't access the O-GlcNAc database directly due to connectivity issues, the documented glycosylation sites suggest this protein undergoes important post-translational modifications that likely regulate its ciliary functions.",
