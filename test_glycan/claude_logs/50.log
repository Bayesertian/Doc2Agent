I'll help you explore the interaction between lectins from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and their glycosylation sites. Let me start by retrieving the lectin data from the UniLectin3D database, then fetch detailed protein information for each lectin.Great! I found lectins from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* in the UniLectin3D database. I can see there are two unique UniProt IDs: Q12396 and P43555. Let me get the complete dataset first to see all the lectins, then fetch detailed protein information for each unique UniProt ID.Let me retrieve the full dataset to see all the UniProt IDs:The API seems to be limiting the display. Let me now fetch detailed protein information for the two unique UniProt IDs I've identified: Q12396 and P43555.There seems to be an SSL issue with the GlyGen API. Let me try to get protein information using the UniProt API instead to gather information about these lectins and their glycosylation sites.Excellent! Now let me get information about the second UniProt ID:Now let me search for specific glycosylation sites (protein sequence features) for these proteins:Let me fix the parameter format:Let me check what types are available:Based on my comprehensive analysis of the *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* lectins from the UniLectin3D database and their detailed protein information, I can provide you with the following insights:

## *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* Lectins Identified

From the UniLectin3D database, I found two distinct lectin proteins:

### 1. **EMP46 (Q12396) - 46 kDa Endomembrane Protein**
- **PDB structures:** 2A6V, 2A6W, 2A6X
- **Gene:** EMP46 (YLR080W)
- **Length:** 444 amino acids
- **Molecular weight:** 50,947 Da

### 2. **EMP47 (P43555) - 47 kDa Endomembrane Protein**
- **PDB structures:** 2A6Y, 2A6Z, 2A70, 2A71
- **Gene:** EMP47 (YFL048C)
- **Length:** 445 amino acids
- **Molecular weight:** 50,330 Da

## Key Structural and Functional Features

### **Lectin Domains:**
Both proteins contain **L-type lectin-like domains**:
- **EMP46:** Residues 52-269
- **EMP47:** Residues 36-254

These domains are responsible for carbohydrate binding, specifically **D-mannose binding**.

### **Membrane Topology:**
Both lectins are **type I membrane proteins** with identical topology:
- **Signal peptide:** EMP46 (1-46), EMP47 (1-28)
- **Lumenal domain:** EMP46 (47-408), EMP47 (29-412)
- **Transmembrane helix:** EMP46 (409-429), EMP47 (413-433)
- **Cytoplasmic tail:** EMP46 (430-444), EMP47 (434-445)

### **Glycosylation Sites Analysis**

**Important finding:** Neither EMP46 nor EMP47 show any annotated N-linked or O-linked glycosylation sites (CARBOHYD features) in the UniProt database. This is somewhat unusual for membrane proteins that traverse the secretory pathway, but could indicate:

1. **Lack of experimental validation** of glycosylation sites
2. **Species-specific differences** in glycosylation patterns
3. **Functional adaptation** where these lectins don't require glycosylation for their cargo receptor function

### **Post-Translational Modifications:**
Both proteins contain:
- **Disulfide bonds:** EMP46 (Cys196-Cys230), EMP47 (Cys179-Cys213)
- **Metal binding:** EMP46 has a potassium-binding site at Tyr177

## Lectin-Protein Interactions and Functional Mechanisms

### **Carbohydrate Recognition:**
- Both lectins bind **D-mannose** and exhibit **carbohydrate binding activity**
- They function as **Ca²⁺-independent cargo receptors**
- Critical for recognizing and sorting **glycoproteins** in the secretory pathway

### **Protein-Protein Interactions:**
1. **Heteromeric complex formation:** EMP46 and EMP47 interact with each other
2. **COPI/COPII coat protein interactions:** Both interact with COP1, SEC21, and SEC23
3. **ER-Golgi transport:** Essential for endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport

### **Functional Significance:**
These lectins serve as **quality control checkpoints** in the secretory pathway by:
- Recognizing properly folded glycoproteins through their carbohydrate modifications
- Facilitating correct sorting and transport between ER and Golgi compartments
- Contributing to cellular glycoprotein homeostasis

## Subcellular Localization

Both proteins are found in:
- **Endoplasmic reticulum membrane**
- **Golgi apparatus membrane**
- **COPII-coated ER to Golgi transport vesicles**

The **di-lysine motifs** (EMP46: 440-444, EMP47: 441-445) are crucial for their ER localization and interaction with coat proteins.

## Clinical and Research Implications

These yeast lectins serve as important model systems for understanding:
- **Glycoprotein quality control mechanisms**
- **Intracellular lectin function**
- **ER-Golgi trafficking processes**
- **Evolution of carbohydrate recognition systems**

The absence of obvious glycosylation sites on these lectins themselves suggests they may represent a specialized class of carbohydrate-binding proteins that don't require glycosylation for their function, focusing instead on recognizing and sorting glycosylated cargo proteins.
