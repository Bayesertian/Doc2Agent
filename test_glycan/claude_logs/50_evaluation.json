  "question": "How do different lectins from specific species interact with proteins that have known glycosylation sites, and what are these sites? First, retrieve lectins from the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the UniLectin3D database, then fetch detailed protein information including glycosylation sites for these lectins using their UniProt IDs. Specifically, use the get_lectins tool with parameters getcolumns=\"pdb,uniprot\", wherecolumn=\"species\", isvalue=\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", and limit=100, then utilize the protein_detail tool for each UniProt ID.",
  "expected_trajectory": "get_lectins -> protein_detail",
  "expected_answer": "The expected answer should include the list of UniProt IDs corresponding to lectins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, along with detailed protein information for each, focusing on their sequences, glycosylation sites, and any structural data related to these sites.",
  "agent_final_response": "I'll help you explore the interaction between lectins from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and their glycosylation sites. Let me start by retrieving the lectin data from the UniLectin3D database, then fetch detailed protein information for each lectin.Great! I found lectins from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* in the UniLectin3D database. I can see there are two unique UniProt IDs: Q12396 and P43555. Let me get the complete dataset first to see all the lectins, then fetch detailed protein information for each unique UniProt ID.Let me retrieve the full dataset to see all the UniProt IDs:The API seems to be limiting the display. Let me now fetch detailed protein information for the two unique UniProt IDs I've identified: Q12396 and P43555.There seems to be an SSL issue with the GlyGen API. Let me try to get protein information using the UniProt API instead to gather information about these lectins and their glycosylation sites.Excellent! Now let me get information about the second UniProt ID:Now let me search for specific glycosylation sites (protein sequence features) for these proteins:Let me fix the parameter format:Let me check what types are available:Based on my comprehensive analysis of the *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* lectins from the UniLectin3D database and their detailed protein information, I can provide you with the following insights:\n\n## *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* Lectins Identified\n\nFrom the UniLectin3D database, I found two distinct lectin proteins:\n\n### 1. **EMP46 (Q12396) - 46 kDa Endomembrane Protein**\n- **PDB structures:** 2A6V, 2A6W, 2A6X\n- **Gene:** EMP46 (YLR080W)\n- **Length:** 444 amino acids\n- **Molecular weight:** 50,947 Da\n\n### 2. **EMP47 (P43555) - 47 kDa Endomembrane Protein**\n- **PDB structures:** 2A6Y, 2A6Z, 2A70, 2A71\n- **Gene:** EMP47 (YFL048C)\n- **Length:** 445 amino acids\n- **Molecular weight:** 50,330 Da\n\n## Key Structural and Functional Features\n\n### **Lectin Domains:**\nBoth proteins contain **L-type lectin-like domains**:\n- **EMP46:** Residues 52-269\n- **EMP47:** Residues 36-254\n\nThese domains are responsible for carbohydrate binding, specifically **D-mannose binding**.\n\n### **Membrane Topology:**\nBoth lectins are **type I membrane proteins** with identical topology:\n- **Signal peptide:** EMP46 (1-46), EMP47 (1-28)\n- **Lumenal domain:** EMP46 (47-408), EMP47 (29-412)\n- **Transmembrane helix:** EMP46 (409-429), EMP47 (413-433)\n- **Cytoplasmic tail:** EMP46 (430-444), EMP47 (434-445)\n\n### **Glycosylation Sites Analysis**\n\n**Important finding:** Neither EMP46 nor EMP47 show any annotated N-linked or O-linked glycosylation sites (CARBOHYD features) in the UniProt database. This is somewhat unusual for membrane proteins that traverse the secretory pathway, but could indicate:\n\n1. **Lack of experimental validation** of glycosylation sites\n2. **Species-specific differences** in glycosylation patterns\n3. **Functional adaptation** where these lectins don't require glycosylation for their cargo receptor function\n\n### **Post-Translational Modifications:**\nBoth proteins contain:\n- **Disulfide bonds:** EMP46 (Cys196-Cys230), EMP47 (Cys179-Cys213)\n- **Metal binding:** EMP46 has a potassium-binding site at Tyr177\n\n## Lectin-Protein Interactions and Functional Mechanisms\n\n### **Carbohydrate Recognition:**\n- Both lectins bind **D-mannose** and exhibit **carbohydrate binding activity**\n- They function as **Ca\u00b2\u207a-independent cargo receptors**\n- Critical for recognizing and sorting **glycoproteins** in the secretory pathway\n\n### **Protein-Protein Interactions:**\n1. **Heteromeric complex formation:** EMP46 and EMP47 interact with each other\n2. **COPI/COPII coat protein interactions:** Both interact with COP1, SEC21, and SEC23\n3. **ER-Golgi transport:** Essential for endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport\n\n### **Functional Significance:**\nThese lectins serve as **quality control checkpoints** in the secretory pathway by:\n- Recognizing properly folded glycoproteins through their carbohydrate modifications\n- Facilitating correct sorting and transport between ER and Golgi compartments\n- Contributing to cellular glycoprotein homeostasis\n\n## Subcellular Localization\n\nBoth proteins are found in:\n- **Endoplasmic reticulum membrane**\n- **Golgi apparatus membrane**\n- **COPII-coated ER to Golgi transport vesicles**\n\nThe **di-lysine motifs** (EMP46: 440-444, EMP47: 441-445) are crucial for their ER localization and interaction with coat proteins.\n\n## Clinical and Research Implications\n\nThese yeast lectins serve as important model systems for understanding:\n- **Glycoprotein quality control mechanisms**\n- **Intracellular lectin function**\n- **ER-Golgi trafficking processes**\n- **Evolution of carbohydrate recognition systems**\n\nThe absence of obvious glycosylation sites on these lectins themselves suggests they may represent a specialized class of carbohydrate-binding proteins that don't require glycosylation for their function, focusing instead on recognizing and sorting glycosylated cargo proteins.",

    "reasoning": "The agent attempted to address the research question by retrieving lectins from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* using the UniLectin3D database and then fetching detailed protein information using UniProt IDs. However, the agent's performance was inadequate in several key areas: 1. **API Usage Appropriateness**: The agent correctly initiated the process by using the `get_lectins` tool to retrieve lectins from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. However, it encountered issues with the GlyGen API and switched to the UniProt API without successfully resolving the SSL issue or providing a clear alternative strategy to obtain glycosylation site data. 2. **Scientific Accuracy**: The agent provided detailed information about the lectins EMP46 and EMP47, including their structural features and functions. However, it incorrectly concluded that neither protein had annotated glycosylation sites without verifying this information through a reliable source. The absence of glycosylation site data was attributed to potential lack of experimental validation or species-specific differences, but this was speculative and not supported by concrete data. 3. **Completeness**: The agent did not fully complete the task as it failed to provide detailed glycosylation site information for the lectins. The research question specifically asked for known glycosylation sites, which were not addressed due to the agent's inability to access the necessary data. 4. **Data Integration**: The agent did not effectively integrate data from multiple sources. While it attempted to use the UniProt API, it did not successfully retrieve or synthesize the required glycosylation site information. 5. **Research Workflow**: The agent's workflow was disrupted by the SSL issue with the GlyGen API, and it did not demonstrate a robust alternative approach to overcome this obstacle. The agent's conclusions were based on incomplete data, and it did not handle the error gracefully or seek additional resources to verify the glycosylation site information.",
