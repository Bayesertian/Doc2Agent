I'll help you find UniProt protein entries for hemoglobin alpha chain isoforms in humans with the specific criteria you mentioned. Let me search for these entries step by step.Let me try a different approach by searching for hemoglobin alpha chain entries first, then filtering by the specific criteria:Great! I found the hemoglobin alpha chain entry. Now let me get the full details to check the sequence length and GO terms:Now let me check for isoforms and get the GO terms for this protein:Let me check if there are other alpha-globin related entries by searching more broadly:Let me also check for the sequence length of the hemoglobin alpha chain and analyze the data we have:Now let me search for UniProt entries with the specific GO term to confirm this association:Let me search more specifically to find all hemoglobin-related proteins:Let me fix the sequence length format:Let me parse the results to count the hemoglobin entries:Let me analyze the XML data directly:Now let me check if these hemoglobin entries are annotated with the GO term for oxygen transport:Perfect! Now I have enough information to answer the question. Let me analyze the final results:Based on my comprehensive search and analysis of UniProt database entries, here is the answer to your question:

**1 reviewed UniProt protein entry** meets all your specified criteria.

**Details:**

The qualifying entry is:
- **P69905** - Hemoglobin subunit alpha (also known as "Hemoglobin alpha chain" and "Alpha-globin")
- Sequence length: 142 amino acids (within the 140-160 range)
- Organism: Homo sapiens (human)
- Status: Reviewed Swiss-Prot entry
- Function: Explicitly described as "Involved in oxygen transport from the lung to the various peripheral tissues"
- GO annotation: Associated with oxygen transport function (GO:0015671)

**Important notes:**

1. The entry P69905 represents the main adult hemoglobin alpha chain and does not have separate isoform entries listed in UniProt - it's treated as a single canonical sequence.

2. I also found P02008 (Hemoglobin subunit zeta), which is an embryonic alpha-type globin chain with similar characteristics, but this is specifically the zeta chain rather than the main "Hemoglobin alpha chain" that was specified in your query.

3. Both proteins have a sequence length of exactly 142 amino acids, which falls within your specified range of 140-160 amino acids.

Therefore, the answer is **1** reviewed UniProt entry for hemoglobin alpha chain isoforms in humans that meets all your criteria.
