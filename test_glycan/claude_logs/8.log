## Glycosylation Pattern of HGF (P14210)

**P14210** encodes **Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)**, a crucial growth factor and cytokine that plays essential roles in tissue regeneration, wound healing, and embryonic development. The protein exhibits a specific glycosylation pattern that significantly influences its biological functions and disease associations.

### Glycosylation Sites

HGF contains **5 confirmed glycosylation sites**:

**N-linked Glycosylation (4 sites):**
1. **Asn294** - N-linked (GlcNAc...) complex-type glycan in Kringle 2 domain
2. **Asn402** - N-linked (GlcNAc...) complex-type glycan in Kringle 4 domain  
3. **Asn566** - N-linked (GlcNAc...) complex-type glycan in β-chain (peptidase domain)
4. **Asn653** - N-linked (GlcNAc...) complex-type glycan in β-chain (peptidase domain)

**O-linked Glycosylation (1 site):**
5. **Thr476** - O-linked (GalNAc...) glycan at the junction between α and β chains

### Structural Characteristics and Glycosylation Impact

**Domain Organization:**
- **α-chain (residues 32-494)**: Contains PAN domain, 4 Kringle domains, and includes N-glycosylation sites at Asn294 and Asn402
- **β-chain (residues 495-728)**: Contains peptidase S1 domain with N-glycosylation sites at Asn566 and Asn653
- **Inter-chain connection**: O-glycosylation at Thr476 near the cleavage site

**Glycosylation Effects on Structure:**
1. **Protein Stability**: The glycosylation enhances protein stability and protects against proteolytic degradation
2. **Proper Folding**: N-linked glycans in the Kringle domains help maintain the complex disulfide bond network (15 disulfide bonds total)
3. **Solubility**: Glycosylation increases protein solubility and prevents aggregation
4. **Processing**: The O-linked glycan at Thr476 may influence the proteolytic processing that converts the single-chain precursor to the active two-chain form

### Disease Associations and Glycosylation

**Primary Disease Association:**
- **Deafness, autosomal recessive, 39 (DFNB39)** - caused by variants affecting HGF gene

**Glycosylation-Related Disease Mechanisms:**

1. **Receptor Binding and Signaling**: 
   - Glycosylation affects HGF binding to its receptor MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor)
   - Proper glycosylation is essential for maintaining the correct conformation for high-affinity receptor interaction
   - Altered glycosylation can impair MET activation and downstream signaling cascades (MAPK, PI3K/AKT pathways)

2. **Protein Processing and Activation**:
   - The O-linked glycan at Thr476 is located near the cleavage site between α and β chains
   - Glycosylation influences the proteolytic processing by TMPRSS13 and HGFAC that activates the protein
   - Improper glycosylation can lead to defective processing and reduced biological activity

3. **Cancer and Metastasis**:
   - Aberrant glycosylation of HGF is associated with various cancers
   - Changes in glycan structures can affect HGF's role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
   - Modified glycosylation patterns can influence tumor progression and metastatic potential

4. **Wound Healing and Tissue Repair**:
   - Glycosylation affects HGF's chemotactic activity and growth factor function
   - Proper glycosylation is essential for effective tissue regeneration and wound healing responses

### Functional Implications

**Isoform Diversity and Glycosylation:**
- HGF has 6 known isoforms, with differential glycosylation potentially affecting their specific activities
- Isoform 4 (HGF/NK2) acts as a competitive antagonist, and its glycosylation pattern may influence this antagonistic activity

**Therapeutic Considerations:**
- Recombinant HGF therapeutics require proper glycosylation for clinical efficacy
- Glycosylation variants may serve as biomarkers for disease progression
- Understanding glycosylation patterns is crucial for developing HGF-based therapies

### Clinical Significance

The glycosylation pattern of HGF is clinically significant because:

1. **Diagnostic Marker**: Altered glycosylation patterns may serve as biomarkers for various diseases
2. **Therapeutic Target**: Modulating glycosylation could enhance therapeutic efficacy of HGF-based treatments
3. **Drug Development**: Understanding glycosylation requirements is essential for developing stable, active recombinant HGF
4. **Personalized Medicine**: Glycosylation variants may explain individual differences in disease susceptibility and treatment response

The intricate glycosylation pattern of HGF demonstrates how post-translational modifications are essential for proper protein function, with direct implications for human health and disease. The strategic positioning of glycosylation sites across different functional domains ensures optimal protein stability, activity, and biological function.
