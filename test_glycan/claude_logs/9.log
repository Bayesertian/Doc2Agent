I'll help you investigate the isotopic variants and their prevalence for the given glycan-related substructure in PubChem. Let me perform a substructure search with the specific parameters you've requested.Excellent! The search successfully identified 50 compounds in PubChem that contain the glycan substructure you specified. The SMILES string `C(C1C(C(C(C(O1)O)O)O)O)O` represents what appears to be a glucose or similar hexose sugar structure.

Here's a summary of the findings:

**Search Results:**
- **Total compounds found:** 50 (maximum limit reached)
- **Search parameters used:**
  - Match isotopes: enabled
  - Match charges: enabled  
  - Maximum search time: 60 seconds
  - Output format: JSON

**Key Observations:**
The search returned 50 unique PubChem Compound IDs (CIDs), indicating that this glycan substructure is quite prevalent in the database. Some notable CIDs include:

- **CID 5988** - Likely a basic glucose structure
- **CID 5280804, 5280805** - These higher numbers suggest more complex derivatives
- **CID 5793, 6072, 6036** - Additional sugar-related compounds
- **CID 157355, 5281233** - Potentially glycosylated compounds

**Analysis:**
1. The fact that we reached the maximum limit of 50 records suggests this substructure is very common in biological compounds
2. The range of CIDs (from 5793 to 44814423) indicates compounds were added to PubChem across different time periods
3. With isotope and charge matching enabled, these results represent exact structural matches including specific isotopic compositions

Would you like me to retrieve detailed information about any specific compounds from this list, or perform additional analysis on particular CIDs to investigate their isotopic variants more thoroughly?
