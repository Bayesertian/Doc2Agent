The WURCS structure is valid with no errors or warnings. Let me also calculate the molecular mass of this glycan:## Structural Representation Changes: IUPAC Extended to WURCS\n\nThe conversion from IUPAC Extended format to WURCS format shows significant changes in how the same glycan structure is represented:\n\n### Original IUPAC Extended Format:\n```\n\u03b1-D-Manp-(1\u21923)[\u03b1-D-Manp-(1\u21926)]-\u03b2-D-Manp-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-D-GlcpNAc-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-D-GlcpNAc-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-D-Glcp-(1\u2192O)Cer\n```\n\n### Converted WURCS Format:\n```\nWURCS=2.0/4,6,5/[a2122h-1b_1-5][a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-2-2-3-4-4/a4-b1_b4-c1_c4-d1_d3-e1_d6-f1\n```\n\n### Key Structural Changes in Representation:\n\n1. **Format Structure**: WURCS uses a highly compact, machine-readable format with four main sections separated by forward slashes, while IUPAC Extended uses descriptive chemical nomenclature.\n\n2. **Monosaccharide Encoding**: \n   - IUPAC Extended explicitly names each sugar (Manp, GlcpNAc, Glcp, Cer)\n   - WURCS encodes sugars as compact strings like `[a2122h-1b_1-5]` for basic sugars and `[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O]` for modified sugars (GlcNAc)\n\n3. **Linkage Information**:\n   - IUPAC Extended shows linkages as `(1\u21923)`, `(1\u21926)`, `(1\u21924)` with anomeric configuration (\u03b1/\u03b2)\n   - WURCS encodes this in the connectivity section `a4-b1_b4-c1_c4-d1_d3-e1_d6-f1`\n\n4. **Branching**: Both formats preserve the branching pattern, but WURCS represents it through its topology section rather than brackets.\n\n5. **Molecular Properties**: The converted structure has a calculated molecular mass of 1072.38 Da and validates without errors, confirming the conversion preserved the chemical structure accurately.\n\nThe WURCS format provides a standardized, unambiguous representation that's ideal for database storage and computational analysis, while maintaining all the structural information present in the original IUPAC Extended notation. This particular glycan structure is not currently registered in the GlyTouCan database, as evidenced by the \"Accession not found\" message.",

This represents an **undetermined linkage position** between the two mannose residues.\n\n### **Comparison with Related Structures**\nThe partial match search revealed several closely related structures with identical composition but **fully determined linkages**:\n\n1. **G08918EL** (Fully determined): `c4-d1` - \u03b1-D-Manp-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-D-Manp linkage\n2. **G22573RC** (Fully determined): `c6-d1` - \u03b1-D-Manp-(1\u21926)-\u03b2-D-Manp linkage  \n3. **G81315DD** (Fully determined): `c3-d1` - \u03b1-D-Manp-(1\u21923)-\u03b2-D-Manp linkage\n4. **G13008EW**: `d1-c3|c6` - mixed linkage pattern\n\n### **No Discrepancies Found**\n- **Mass calculations** are consistent (748.27 Da)\n- **Composition** matches exactly across all related structures\n- **WURCS format** is structurally valid\n- **GlyTouCan ID** (G03717EM) is correctly assigned and well-documented\n\n### **Biological Significance**\nThis structure appears in multiple species (human, mouse, rat, fruit fly, SARS-CoV-2) and is found on important proteins including:\n- Immunoglobulin heavy chain epsilon (IgE)\n- SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\n- Various other glycoproteins\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe conversion is **accurate and consistent** with existing database entries. The structure represents a **partially characterized glycan** where the exact linkage position between mannose residues remains undetermined (`?` linkage), which is appropriately represented in both the original GWS format and the resulting WURCS notation. This ambiguity likely reflects experimental limitations in determining the precise linkage position, which is common in glycan structural analysis.",

Here's what the data reveals:\n\n**Summary of Trefoil Lectins in Bacteria:**\n\nThe database contains 2,001 entries of trefoil lectins from bacterial sources. From the sample data shown, I can see two main domain types represented:\n\n1. **Ricin-like domain** - This appears to be the most common type among bacterial trefoil lectins\n2. **Earthworm lectin-like domain** - Another domain type found in bacterial trefoil lectins\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Many entries lack UniProt identifiers (showing as empty strings), suggesting these may be predicted or uncharacterized proteins\n- Some entries do have UniProt accessions (e.g., A0A0M1J4I1), indicating characterized proteins\n- All entries are confirmed to be from the Bacteria superkingdom\n\nThe high number of trefoil lectins found in bacteria (over 2,000 entries) indicates that these proteins are quite prevalent in bacterial genomes. Trefoil lectins are characterized by their distinctive three-loop structure and are important for various biological processes including cell adhesion, immune responses, and pathogen recognition.\n\nWould you like me to analyze any specific aspects of these bacterial trefoil lectins in more detail, such as focusing on entries with UniProt identifiers or exploring particular domain types?",

</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n\nBased on my analysis of the glycan structure visualization using your WURCS notation, here are the key differences between SVG and PNG formats:\n\n## **Technical Rendering Differences**\n\n**SVG Format Advantages:**\n- **Vector-based scalability**: The glycan structure maintains perfect clarity at any zoom level\n- **Crisp text rendering**: Sugar names (GlcNAc, Gal) remain sharp and readable\n- **Precise geometric shapes**: Circles and squares have mathematically perfect boundaries\n- **XML structure**: Contains semantic information about each glycan component\n- **Interactive potential**: Can be enhanced with CSS animations and JavaScript\n\n**PNG Format Characteristics:**\n- **Fixed resolution**: Limited to 238\u00d7134 pixels for this specific image\n- **Raster-based**: Quality degrades when enlarged beyond original size\n- **Compression artifacts**: Some subtle color variations due to PNG compression\n- **Faster loading**: Binary format loads more quickly than XML parsing\n- **Universal compatibility**: Works seamlessly across all platforms\n\n## **Structural Representation Analysis**\n\nBoth formats accurately represent your complex glycan structure with:\n- **5 monosaccharide units** arranged in a branched pattern\n- **Color-coded residues** following SNFG nomenclature (yellow squares for GlcNAc, red circles for Gal)\n- **Clear linkage visualization** showing the glycosidic bonds between units\n- **Proper spatial arrangement** reflecting the 3D molecular structure\n\n## **Scientific Use Case Recommendations**\n\n**For research publications**: SVG provides superior print quality and allows readers to zoom for detailed examination of complex structures.\n\n**For web databases**: PNG offers faster loading for large glycan libraries, while SVG enables interactive features like hover-over annotations.\n\n**For presentations**: SVG's scalability ensures clarity when projecting or viewing on different screen sizes.\n\nThe choice between formats depends on your specific requirements for scalability, file size, and intended use case in glycobiology research.",

The expected trajectory involved using a specific API to search for natural variants by HGVS expression, but the agent's approach was scattered and did not follow a logical workflow. The agent's attempts to search by genomic coordinates and other indirect methods were not successful in addressing the research question."

Insulin Signaling and Glucose Metabolism**\n- **Insulin-mediated regulation**: The UniProt data indicates that \"insulin promotes nuclear location\" and \"levels are controlled by insulin and SP1 phosphorylation states\"\n- **O-GlcNAcylation contains 8 N-acetylglucosamine side chains** and is insulin-responsive\n- **Sequential modification**: \"On insulin stimulation, sequentially glycosylated and phosphorylated on several C-terminal serine and threonine residues\"\n\n#### **2. Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Shuttling**\n- **Location control**: \"Nuclear location is governed by glycosylated/phosphorylated states\"\n- **Hormonal regulation**: \"Insulin promotes nuclear location, while glucagon favors cytoplasmic location\"\n- This suggests O-GlcNAcylation acts as a metabolic sensor, directing SP1 subcellular localization based on nutrient status\n\n#### **3. Transcriptional Activity Modulation**\n- **Protein interactions**: O-GlcNAcylation \"affects transcriptional activity through disrupting the interaction with a number of transcription factors including ELF1 and NFYA\"\n- **Inhibitory effects**: \"Also inhibits interaction with the HIV1 promoter\"\n- **Competition with phosphorylation**: Several sites show \"alternate\" O-GlcNAcylation/phosphorylation, indicating dynamic competition between these modifications\n\n#### **4. Metabolic Gene Regulation**\n- **BMAL1 regulation**: SP1 \"positively regulates the transcription of the core clock component BMAL1,\" linking it to circadian metabolism\n- **VEGF pathway**: MAPK-mediated phosphorylation \"enhances VEGF transcription but represses FGF2-triggered PDGFR-alpha transcription\"\n\n### **Clinical and Therapeutic Implications**\n\n#### **1. Diabetes and Metabolic Disease**\n- The extensive O-GlcNAcylation and insulin responsiveness suggest SP1 is a key node in glucose sensing\n- Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation could contribute to diabetic complications\n\n#### **2. Cancer**\n- **Overexpression**: \"Up-regulated in adenocarcinomas of the stomach\"\n- **Telomerase activation**: \"maintains telomerase activity in cancer cells by inducing TERT and TERC gene expression\"\n\n#### **3. Oxidative Stress Response**\n- SP1 plays \"a role in protecting cells against oxidative stress following brain injury\"\n\n### **Sequence Information**\nThe protein sequence (785 aa) contains multiple functional domains:\n- Repressor domain (2-82)\n- Three transactivation domains (A: 146-251, B: 261-495, C: 496-610)\n- Three C2H2-type zinc fingers (626-650, 656-680, 686-708)\n- Domain D (708-785)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nSP1 represents a highly modified transcription factor where O-GlcNAcylation serves as a critical metabolic sensor. The modification pattern suggests that O-GlcNAcylation coordinates with phosphorylation to regulate SP1's nuclear localization, protein interactions, and transcriptional activity in response to metabolic signals like insulin and glucose availability. This makes SP1 a key integration point between cellular metabolism and gene expression, with significant implications for metabolic diseases and cancer.",

The conversion system indicates \"Accession not found\" when attempting to retrieve the unique identifier.\n\n## Validation Results\n\nThe WURCS validation shows that while the structure is syntactically valid, there are some warnings about \"too many linkages on the backbone\" for each residue position. This suggests that the composition-to-WURCS conversion has generated a structure with ambiguous or undefined linkage positions (indicated by the \"a?|b?|c?|d?|e?|f?|g?\" notation), which is typical when converting from composition data that doesn't specify exact linkage positions and anomeric configurations.\n\nThis glycan composition represents a complex N-linked or O-linked glycan structure commonly found in glycoproteins, containing sialic acid, fucose, and multiple hexose and N-acetylhexosamine residues.",

The most clinically significant is the HbA1c glycation site at position 2 of the beta chain, which serves as a biomarker for long-term glucose control in diabetes. These glycation modifications occur slowly and continuously throughout the 120-day lifespan of red blood cells, with rates increased in diabetic patients.",

Functional CHAIN Features Present\nAll three proteins contain essential CHAIN features:\n- **Hemoglobin Alpha**: PRO_0000052653 (main chain)\n- **Hemoglobin Beta**: PRO_0000052976 (main chain)  \n- **Insulin**: PRO_0000015819 (B chain), PRO_0000015821 (A chain), PRO_0000015820 (C peptide)\n\n### 5. CARBOHYD Features Present\n- **Hemoglobin subunits**: Multiple CARBOHYD features representing glycation sites\n- **Insulin**: No CARBOHYD features (no glycosylation sites)\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that while hemoglobin subunits undergo extensive PTMs including clinically relevant glycation, insulin's modifications are primarily limited to essential disulfide bond formation for proper folding and function.\n\nI have successfully identified and analyzed the sequence features related to post-translational modifications (PTMs) and carbohydrate-binding motifs in human Hemoglobin and Insulin proteins from UniProt. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Summary of Results:\n\n### **Hemoglobin Alpha (P69905)**\n- **11 phosphorylation sites** (serine, threonine, tyrosine)\n- **4 lysine modification sites** (acetylation/succinylation)\n- **4 glycation sites** with glucose (CARBOHYD features)\n- **CHAIN feature**: Main hemoglobin alpha chain (PRO_0000052653)\n\n### **Hemoglobin Beta (P68871)**\n- **5 phosphorylation sites** \n- **4 acetylation sites** (aspirin-induced)\n- **1 S-nitrosylation site** (Cys-94, critical for oxygen regulation)\n- **6 glycation sites**, including **Val-2 forming HbA1c** (diabetes marker)\n- **CHAIN feature**: Main hemoglobin beta chain (PRO_0000052976)\n\n### **Insulin (P01308)**\n- **3 critical disulfide bonds** (PTM category)\n- **3 CHAIN features**: B chain, A chain, and C peptide\n- **No CARBOHYD features** (no glycosylation sites)\n- Functions through protein-protein interactions rather than carbohydrate binding\n\n## Clinical Significance:\n1. **HbA1c formation** in hemoglobin beta serves as a diabetes biomarker\n2. **Aspirin acetylation** of hemoglobin affects oxygen transport\n3. **Insulin disulfide bonds** are essential for proper function\n4. **S-nitrosylation** regulates oxygen delivery\n\nAll proteins are reviewed UniProt entries with verified CHAIN features, and hemoglobin subunits contain multiple CARBOHYD features representing glycation sites important for both normal physiology and disease monitoring.",

The mouse data (P52480 - Pyruvate Kinase) shows extensive phosphorylation across multiple sites and tissues, while human PGK1 data retrieved under these specific criteria shows limited phosphorylation evidence. Future investigations should focus on obtaining correct mouse PGK1 data and expanding search parameters for comprehensive comparative analysis.\n\nBased on my analysis of the PTM data, I found an important discrepancy that needs to be addressed.

It's actually the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, not a human protein related to Alzheimer's disease.\n\n2. **Q67890** - This is a Hepatitis B virus protein (Large envelope protein), not a human protein.\n\n### **Actual Variant Data for rs121918508:**\nThe dbSNP ID rs121918508 you specified is indeed a real variant, but it's found in **human FGFR2 proteins** (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2), specifically:\n\n- **Primary protein**: P21802 (FGFR2_HUMAN)\n- **Genomic location**: Chromosome 10q26.13\n- **Variant type**: Missense mutations at position 648 (in P21802)\n- **Wild-type amino acid**: Alanine (A)\n- **Alternative sequences**: Threonine (T), Proline (P), or Serine (S)\n\n### **Disease Associations:**\nThis variant is associated with:\n- **Lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital syndrome 1 (LADD1)** - OMIM:149730\n- **FGFR2-related craniosynostosis**\n- **Familial scaphocephaly syndrome, McGillivray type** - OMIM:609579\n- **Levy-Hollister syndrome (LADD)**\n\n### **Clinical Significance:**\n- **Pathogenic** - confirmed by multiple sources (ClinVar, UniProt, Ensembl)\n- **Very rare variant** - allele frequency of 6.84e-7 in gnomAD\n- **Cross-referenced** in ClinVar, dbSNP, and multiple other databases\n\n## **Important Notes:**\n1. **No Alzheimer's Disease 1 association** - This variant is not associated with Alzheimer's disease but rather with developmental syndromes affecting craniofacial development.\n\n2. **Position criteria not met** - The variant occurs at position 648, which is outside your specified range of positions 10-60.\n\n3. **Alternative sequence criteria** - While you specified Valine (V) or deletion (-), the actual alternatives for this SNP are Threonine (T), Proline (P), and Serine (S).\n\nIt appears there may be some confusion in your query parameters. If you're specifically interested in Alzheimer's disease-associated variants, you might want to look at different proteins like APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2, or provide different UniProt accessions for human proteins actually associated with Alzheimer's disease.",

Anomeric Configuration Variability\n- **G48061MK:** Unknown anomer (x) at reducing end\n- **G51197ZR & G44161QY:** Defined \u03b2-configuration\n- **Biological Significance:** May affect enzyme recognition and binding specificity\n\n#### 2. Sialylation Extension (G44161QY)\n- **Novel Element:** \u03b12\u21926 linked N-acetylneuraminic acid\n- **Structural Impact:** Adds negative charge and increases molecular complexity\n- **Functional Implications:** Enhanced cell surface recognition, potential immune modulation\n\n#### 3. Complex Branching Architecture\n- **Base Pattern:** Linear backbone with single branch point\n- **Extended Pattern (G44161QY):** Multi-branched with additional sialylated arm\n- **Architecture:** Transition from simple Y-structure to complex tree-like topology\n\n### Comparative Structural Analysis\n\n| Feature | Original Query | G48061MK | G51197ZR | G44161QY |\n|---------|----------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Residue Count | 5 | 5 | 5 | 9 |\n| Unique Residues | 5 | 5 | 5 | 7 |\n| Linkages | 4 | 4 | 4 | 8 |\n| N-Acetyl Groups | 2 | 2 | 2 | 4 |\n| Sialic Acid | No | No | No | Yes |\n| Reducing End | Unknown | Unknown | \u03b2-Glc | \u03b2-Glc |\n\n## Biological and Functional Implications\n\n### Structural Conservation\nThe conservation of the core pentasaccharide structure across all matches suggests this motif represents a functionally important glycan framework, likely involved in:\n- Cell surface recognition\n- Protein-carbohydrate interactions\n- Immune system signaling\n\n### Structural Diversification\nThe progressive complexity from the base structure to G44161QY demonstrates:\n- **Biosynthetic Pathway Evolution:** Sequential addition of decorating enzymes\n- **Functional Specialization:** Enhanced binding specificity through sialylation\n- **Tissue-Specific Expression:** Complex structures may be restricted to specific cell types\n\n### Novel Therapeutic Targets\nThe sialylated variant (G44161QY) presents unique features that could serve as:\n- Biomarkers for specific disease states\n- Targets for therapeutic intervention\n- Templates for synthetic glycan design\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe partial match analysis reveals a family of related glycan structures with shared core architecture but distinct decorative patterns. The most significant novel feature is the sialylation extension in G44161QY, which transforms the simple branched structure into a complex, functionally diverse glycan suitable for sophisticated biological recognition processes. The anomeric variability at the reducing end further adds to the structural diversity and potential functional specificity of these glycan family members.\n\nBased on the retrieved data, I can identify several key structural patterns and novel features.I've completed a comprehensive analysis of your WURCS structure and its partial matches. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Summary of Results\n\n**3 Partial Matches Found:**\n1. **G48061MK** - Exact match with unknown anomeric configuration\n2. **G51197ZR** - Near-identical with defined \u03b2-glucose at reducing end  \n3. **G44161QY** - Extended structure with sialylation\n\n## Most Significant Novel Features\n\n**Sialylation Extension (G44161QY):** The most striking novel feature is the addition of N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) linked \u03b12\u21926, which:\n- Doubles the molecular complexity (9 residues vs 5)\n- Introduces negative charge\n- Creates potential for enhanced biological recognition\n- Suggests tissue-specific or disease-related expression\n\n**Anomeric Configuration Differences:** The variation between unknown (x) and defined \u03b2-anomers at the reducing end indicates potential enzymatic specificity differences.\n\n## Structural Relationships\n\nAll structures share a common **pentasaccharide core** with consistent N-acetylation patterns, suggesting this represents a fundamental biological building block. The G44161QY structure appears to be a decorated version of the base structure, indicating a possible biosynthetic pathway where the core structure is elaborated through additional enzymatic modifications.\n\nThe analysis reveals these glycans likely represent a functionally related family involved in cell surface recognition, with the sialylated variant potentially serving specialized roles in immune signaling or pathological processes.",

This mass is typical for complex N-linked or O-linked glycans found in biological systems, suggesting it's neither too small to be functionally insignificant nor too large to be biosynthetically challenging.\n\n**Structural Validity**: The positive validation for glycosylation composition indicates that the monosaccharide units, their linkages, and overall structural arrangement are chemically and biologically feasible. This suggests the structure could realistically occur as a post-translational modification on proteins.\n\n**Biological Relevance**: The combination of appropriate mass (910 Da) and valid composition suggests this glycan structure is within the range typically found in naturally occurring glycoproteins. Glycans of this size often play important roles in protein folding, stability, cell recognition, and signaling processes.\n\n**Synthetic Accessibility**: The validation confirms that the linkage patterns and monosaccharide arrangements are chemically reasonable, which is important for both understanding natural biosynthetic pathways and potential synthetic approaches to generate such structures.\n\nThe concordance between the calculated mass and positive validation for glycosylation composition indicates this WURCS structure represents a biologically plausible glycan that could serve functional roles in glycoprotein systems.",

Here's what I discovered:\n\n### 1. Bacterial Lectin Retrieval\nI successfully retrieved bacterial lectin data from the UniLectin database using the `get_propeller_lectins` function with the specified parameters. The search returned 11 bacterial lectins with the following characteristics:\n\n**Identified Bacterial Lectins:**\n- **A8ZQR7** from *Acaryochloris marina* (strain MBIC 11017) - FG-GAP repeat protein with multiple lectin-associated domains\n- **B0BZ62** from *Acaryochloris marina* (strain MBIC 11017) - VCBS domain protein with extensive lectin-like features\n- **B0C419** from *Acaryochloris marina* (strain MBIC 11017) - Additional bacterial lectin\n- **A0A182DW20** from *Escherichia coli* - PapG lectin domain protein\n\n### 2. Detailed Protein Characterization\n\n**A8ZQR7** - This is a large bacterial lectin (1566 amino acids) containing:\n- DUF4347 domain (positions 17-185)\n- Calx-beta domain (positions 546-652)\n- Multiple FG-GAP repeat domains\n- Calcium-binding hemolysin-type domains\n- Located on plasmid pREB7 in the cyanobacterium\n\n**B0BZ62** - An even larger bacterial lectin (2531 amino acids) featuring:\n- Multiple VCBS repeat domains\n- Cadherin-like domains\n- FG-GAP repeat domains\n- Calcium-binding domains\n- PbH1 domains\n- Located on the main chromosome\n\n### 3. Proteomics Data Investigation\n\nUnfortunately, **none of the identified bacterial lectins had available proteomics peptide data** in the UniProt proteomics database. This finding reveals an important limitation:\n\n- Bacterial proteins, especially from non-model organisms like *Acaryochloris marina*, generally lack extensive proteomics characterization\n- The proteomics databases primarily contain data from well-studied model organisms\n- Even E. coli lectins showed no available proteomics peptide data\n\n### 4. Comparative Analysis\n\nFor comparison, I was able to successfully retrieve extensive proteomics data for **P17931** (human galectin-3), which showed:\n- 80+ unique peptides identified\n- Data from multiple proteomics databases (PeptideAtlas, ProteomicsDB)\n- High confidence identifications with detailed scoring metrics\n- Evidence from thousands of mass spectrometry observations\n\n### 5. Biological Implications\n\nThe identified bacterial lectins show several interesting features for potential glycan interactions:\n\n1. **Multiple carbohydrate-binding domains** - Both A8ZQR7 and B0BZ62 contain numerous repeat domains that could provide multivalent glycan binding\n2. **Calcium-dependent binding** - The presence of calcium-binding domains suggests these lectins may require Ca\u00b2\u207a for optimal glycan binding activity\n3. **Cell surface localization signals** - Both proteins contain signal sequences suggesting they may be involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions\n4. **Structural diversity** - The different domain architectures (FG-GAP vs VCBS repeats) suggest varied glycan recognition patterns\n\n### 6. Research Recommendations\n\nTo advance the study of bacterial lectin-glycan interactions, I recommend:\n\n1. **Targeted proteomics studies** of these bacterial lectins using species-specific mass spectrometry approaches\n2. **Glycan array screening** to characterize the carbohydrate binding specificity of these bacterial lectins\n3. **Structural studies** to understand the molecular basis of their glycan recognition\n4. **Functional studies** in the native bacterial context to understand their biological roles\n\nThis investigation successfully identified novel bacterial lectins with potential for glycan interactions, though it highlighted the current limitations in bacterial proteomics data availability.",

This analysis examines genetic variants that may affect glycosylation patterns and protein function, with emphasis on their clinical significance.\n\n## Protein Structure and Glycosylation Sites\n\n### Basic Information\n- **Gene**: SERPINA1\n- **Protein**: Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT)\n- **UniProt ID**: P01009\n- **Sequence Length**: 418 amino acids (mature protein: residues 25-418)\n- **Location**: Chromosome 14q32.13\n\n### N-Glycosylation Sites\nSERPINA1 contains three confirmed N-linked glycosylation sites:\n\n1. **Asn-70**: N-linked (GlcNAc...) complex type\n   - Structure: Hex5HexNAc4 with di-antennary structure\n   - Some antennae are fucosylated forming Lewis-X determinants\n\n2. **Asn-107**: N-linked (GlcNAc...) complex type\n   - Can be di-antennary, tri-antennary, or tetra-antennary\n   - Variable glycan structure affects protein properties\n\n3. **Asn-271**: N-linked (GlcNAc...) complex type\n   - Exclusively di-antennary structure\n   - Structure: Hex5HexNAc4\n\n### Glycosylation Impact\nThe differential glycosylation produces multiple protein isoforms with varying:\n- Protein stability and folding\n- Secretion efficiency\n- Biological activity\n- Protein-protein interactions\n\n## Critical Variants Affecting Glycosylation\n\n### 1. Z-Bristol Variant (T109M) - VAR_011620\n- **Position**: 109 (in glycosylation site vicinity of Asn-107)\n- **Change**: Threonine \u2192 Methionine\n- **dbSNP**: rs199422213\n- **Clinical Significance**: Pathogenic\n- **Functional Impact**: \n  - **Disrupts N-glycosylation site at Asn-107**\n  - Deficient AAT with very low serum levels\n  - Causes protein misfolding and retention in ER\n- **Disease Association**: Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency\n- **Population Frequency**: 0.000029443 (gnomAD)\n\nThis variant is particularly significant as it directly affects the N-glycosylation consensus sequence (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) at position 107, preventing proper glycan attachment.\n\n## Major Disease-Associated Variants\n\n### 1. Z Allele (E366K) - VAR_007004\n- **Position**: 366\n- **Change**: Glutamate \u2192 Lysine\n- **dbSNP**: rs28929474\n- **Clinical Significance**: Pathogenic\n- **Population Frequency**: 0.016249 (1.6% - relatively common)\n- **Functional Impact**:\n  - Severe protein misfolding and aggregation\n  - Accumulation in endoplasmic reticulum\n  - Dramatically reduced secretion\n  - Associated with A-237 mutation in some cases\n- **Disease Associations**:\n  - Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (primary)\n  - COPD, severe early onset\n  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n  - Inborn genetic diseases\n  - SERPINA1-related disorders\n\n### 2. S Allele (E288V) - VAR_007000\n- **Position**: 288\n- **Change**: Glutamate \u2192 Valine\n- **dbSNP**: rs17580\n- **Clinical Significance**: Pathogenic\n- **Functional Impact**:\n  - Moderately reduced protein secretion\n  - Less severe than Z allele but still clinically significant\n  - Often found in compound heterozygotes\n\n### 3. M-Malton (\u039475) - VAR_006984\n- **Position**: 75 (deletion)\n- **Functional Impact**:\n  - Complete loss of amino acid\n  - Very low serum AAT levels\n  - Associated with chronic emphysema and infantile liver cirrhosis\n- **Clinical Significance**: Highly pathogenic\n\n## Variants Affecting Protein Function and Stability\n\n### Pittsburgh Variant (M382R) - VAR_007005\n- **Position**: 382 (reactive center loop)\n- **Change**: Methionine \u2192 Arginine\n- **dbSNP**: rs121912713\n- **Functional Impact**:\n  - Changes substrate specificity from elastase to thrombin\n  - Gains antithrombin activity\n  - Inhibits factor VIIa activity\n  - **Causes fatal bleeding diathesis**\n- **Clinical Significance**: Pathogenic with altered function\n\n### Other Notable Variants\n- **M1A (E237A)**: Common allele (20-23% frequency)\n- **M2 (R125H + E400D)**: Associated with D-400\n- **M3 (E400D)**: Moderate frequency variant\n- **X (E228K)**: Less common variant\n\n## Glycosylation-Related Functional Impacts\n\n### Direct Glycosylation Site Disruption\n1. **T109M (Z-Bristol)**: Directly prevents N-glycosylation at Asn-107\n2. **Variants near glycosylation sites**: May affect glycan processing or accessibility\n\n### Indirect Effects on Glycosylation\n1. **Protein Folding Variants**: \n   - Z allele (E366K) causes misfolding, potentially affecting glycan processing\n   - S allele (E288V) may alter protein conformation affecting glycosylation efficiency\n\n2. **ER Retention**: \n   - Misfolded variants (Z, S) accumulate in ER\n   - Prolonged ER residence may alter glycan modification patterns\n   - Interaction with ER chaperones (CANX, PDIA3) affects folding and glycosylation\n\n## Clinical Correlations\n\n### Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency (A1ATD)\n- **OMIM**: 613490\n- **Primary manifestations**:\n  - Pulmonary emphysema (typically 3rd-4th decade)\n  - Liver disease (children and adults)\n  - Potential progression to cirrhosis and liver failure\n\n### Genotype-Phenotype Correlations\n- **ZZ homozygotes**: Severe deficiency (~10-15% normal levels)\n- **SZ compound heterozygotes**: Moderate deficiency (~40% normal levels)\n- **MZ heterozygotes**: Mild deficiency (~60% normal levels)\n- **Null variants**: Complete absence of circulating protein\n\n### Environmental Modifiers\n- **Cigarette smoking**: Dramatically increases emphysema risk\n- **Occupational exposures**: Dust, chemicals accelerate lung disease\n- **Infections**: May trigger acute exacerbations\n\n## Therapeutic Implications\n\n### Current Treatments\n1. **Augmentation Therapy**: IV infusion of purified AAT\n2. **Lung Transplantation**: For end-stage disease\n3. **Liver Transplantation**: For severe hepatic involvement\n\n### Emerging Therapeutic Approaches\n1. **Gene Therapy**: Delivery of normal SERPINA1 gene\n2. **Small Molecule Chaperones**: To improve Z variant folding\n3. **Autophagy Enhancement**: To clear aggregated protein\n4. **Anti-inflammatory Therapies**: To reduce tissue damage\n\n## Research and Clinical Recommendations\n\n### Genetic Testing Considerations\n- Screen individuals with early-onset emphysema\n- Family screening for known variant carriers\n- Consider glycosylation analysis in cases with atypical presentation\n\n### Functional Studies Needed\n- Detailed glycosylation pattern analysis for each variant\n- Correlation between glycosylation patterns and protein stability\n- Impact of variant glycosylation on protein-protein interactions\n\n### Clinical Monitoring\n- Regular pulmonary function testing\n- Liver function monitoring\n- Family counseling and genetic screening\n- Lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation, occupational precautions)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSERPINA1 variants present a complex landscape of genetic defects affecting protein function through multiple mechanisms:\n\n1. **Direct glycosylation disruption** (T109M) prevents proper protein modification\n2. **Protein folding defects** (E366K, E288V) indirectly affect glycosylation through ER retention\n3. **Functional alterations** (M382R) change substrate specificity\n4. **Deletion variants** (\u039475) cause severe protein deficiency\n\nThe interplay between genetic variation, glycosylation patterns, and clinical phenotype underscores the complexity of SERPINA1-related diseases and highlights the need for personalized therapeutic approaches based on specific variant effects on protein structure, modification, and function.\n\nUnderstanding these relationships is crucial for:\n- Accurate genetic counseling\n- Personalized treatment strategies\n- Development of variant-specific therapies\n- Early intervention to prevent disease progression\nI've conducted a comprehensive analysis of genetic variants in SERPINA1 (Alpha-1-antitrypsin) that affect glycosylation patterns and protein function. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Major Discoveries:\n\n### **Glycosylation-Disrupting Variants:**\n1. **T109M (Z-Bristol variant)**: Directly disrupts the N-glycosylation site at Asn-107, preventing proper glycan attachment and causing severe protein deficiency.\n\n### **Critical Pathogenic Variants:**\n1. **E366K (Z allele)**: The most significant variant (1.6% population frequency) causing severe protein misfolding, ER retention, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency\n2. **E288V (S allele)**: Moderately severe variant affecting protein secretion\n3. **M382R (Pittsburgh variant)**: Changes protein function from elastase inhibitor to thrombin inhibitor, causing bleeding disorders\n\n### **Clinical Significance:**\n- These variants are strongly associated with **Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD)**\n- Lead to pulmonary emphysema, liver disease, and COPD\n- The Z variant alone accounts for most severe cases of A1ATD\n\n### **Glycosylation Impact:**\n- SERPINA1 has 3 N-glycosylation sites (Asn-70, Asn-107, Asn-271)\n- Variants affecting glycosylation can disrupt protein folding, secretion, and stability\n- The T109M variant specifically eliminates glycosylation at a critical site\n\nThe analysis reveals that genetic variants in SERPINA1 affect protein function through multiple mechanisms - direct glycosylation disruption, protein misfolding leading to ER retention, and altered substrate specificity. This comprehensive understanding is essential for developing targeted therapies and providing accurate genetic counseling for patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.",

The isoform 3 variant (Q9NXB0-3) with its N-terminal modifications may provide tissue-specific or developmental regulation, demonstrating the sophisticated evolutionary mechanisms that have evolved to fine-tune ciliary function in human development and health.\n\nThe protein's association with multiple severe genetic disorders underscores its clinical importance, while its conservation across species emphasizes its fundamental biological significance in eukaryotic cell biology and development.\nI've provided a comprehensive analysis of the MKS1 protein encoded by UniProt accession Q9NXB0-3, covering its evolutionary implications and functional modifications. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Summary of Key Points:\n\n**Evolutionary Significance:**\n- MKS1 contains a highly conserved C2 B9-type domain (residues 311-439) that's essential for ciliary transition zone function\n- The protein shows conservation across the eukaryotic lineage, particularly in metazoans\n- Three isoforms exist, including Q9NXB0-3 with N-terminal modifications, suggesting evolutionary fine-tuning\n\n**Functional Modifications:**\n- **Glycosylation**: 2 documented glycosylation sites (though specific O-GlcNAc data wasn't accessible)\n- **Phosphorylation**: Identified in phosphoproteomic studies\n- **Alternative splicing**: Isoform 3 has modified N-terminus (VSP_046063, residues 1-26)\n\n**Cross-References Found:**\n- Multiple sequence databases (EMBL, RefSeq, CCDS)\n- Interaction databases (BioGRID: 130 interactions, STRING)\n- Glycosylation database (GlyGen: 2 sites)\n- Complex database (ComplexPortal: MKS transition zone complex)\n\n**Clinical Relevance:**\nThe protein is associated with three major ciliopathies (Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and Joubert syndrome), with numerous disease-causing variants identified throughout the sequence.\n\n**Functional Context:**\nMKS1 is part of the tectonic-like complex that acts as a critical barrier at the ciliary transition zone, regulating protein trafficking between the cytoplasm and ciliary compartment.\n\nWhile I couldn't access the O-GlcNAc database directly due to connectivity issues, the documented glycosylation sites suggest this protein undergoes important post-translational modifications that likely regulate its ciliary functions.",

Epitope Characterization\nGiven the extensive epitope data for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein:\n- Focus on well-characterized epitopes from major studies\n- Prioritize epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD)\n- Consider N-linked glycosylation sites (N61, N74, N122, N149, N165, N234, N282, N331, N343, N616, N657, N709, N717, N801, N1074, N1098, N1134, N1158, N1173, N1194)\n\n### 2. Glycan-Lectin Interaction Potential\nBased on known SARS-CoV-2 spike protein characteristics:\n- **High-mannose glycans**: Common on viral proteins, recognized by mannose-binding lectins\n- **Complex glycans**: Present on mature spike protein, may interact with galectins\n- **Sialic acid**: Terminal modifications that could interact with siglecs\n\n### 3. Recommended Ligand Search Strategy\nDue to the complexity of direct epitope-ligand mapping:\n\n#### A. Glycosylation Site-Based Approach\n- Search for ligands containing mannose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine\n- Focus on common viral glycan structures\n- Use IUPAC nomenclature for glycan searches\n\n#### B. Lectin-Mediated Interactions\n- Identify human lectins that could bind viral glycans\n- Search for corresponding ligand structures in UniLectin\n- Consider both innate immune lectins and cell surface receptors\n\n#### C. Structural Biology Approach\n- Use PDB structures of lectin-glycan complexes\n- Identify glycan motifs that bind to known lectins\n- Model potential interactions with spike protein epitopes\n\n## Limitations and Considerations\n\n### Data Volume\n- SARS-CoV-2 epitope data is extremely comprehensive\n- Direct processing requires data filtering and pagination\n- Focus on high-confidence, well-characterized epitopes\n\n### Database Connectivity\n- Ligand-specific queries may require refinement of search parameters\n- Cross-referencing between epitope and ligand databases needs manual curation\n- Consider using glycan structure databases (GlyTouCan, UniCarbKB) as intermediates\n\n## Recommendations for Future Analysis\n\n### 1. Targeted Epitope Selection\n- Focus on RBD epitopes (residues 319-541)\n- Prioritize neutralizing antibody epitopes\n- Consider escape variant hotspots\n\n### 2. Glycan-Centric Approach\n- Use glycan composition and structure as the primary search criterion\n- Map known spike protein glycans to available ligand structures\n- Consider glycan processing differences between host and pathogen\n\n### 3. Functional Validation\n- Prioritize interactions with known biological relevance\n- Consider tissue-specific lectin expression\n- Evaluate potential therapeutic implications\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile direct epitope-ligand mapping faces technical challenges due to data volume, a systematic approach focusing on glycan structures and lectin interactions provides a viable pathway for identifying potential therapeutic targets and understanding viral-host interactions at the molecular level.\n\nThe analysis framework established here can be applied to other viral proteins and adapted for different pathogen-host interaction studies.\nBased on my analysis, I've encountered some practical challenges but can provide you with a comprehensive framework for identifying potential ligand interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes.\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n**Challenge with Epitope Data**: The epitope database for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (P0DTC2) contains an extremely large dataset that exceeds processing limits even with small result sets. This indicates the extensive research conducted on this protein.\n\n**Available Resources**: I successfully identified several relevant databases:\n- **Lectin Structures**: Found 11 lectin entries with PDB and UniProt mappings\n- **Human Lectome**: Retrieved 11 human lectin entries that could potentially interact with viral epitopes\n\n## Recommended Approach:\n\nSince direct epitope-ligand mapping faces technical constraints, I suggest a **glycan-centric approach**:\n\n1. **Focus on Known Glycosylation Sites**: The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has 22 N-linked glycosylation sites, which are prime targets for lectin interactions.\n\n2. **Target Specific Glycan Motifs**: Search for ligands containing:\n   - High-mannose structures (common on viral proteins)\n   - Complex glycans with galactose and sialic acid\n   - N-acetylglucosamine-containing structures\n\n3. **Leverage Structural Biology**: Use PDB structures from the lectin database to identify glycan-binding motifs that could interact with spike protein epitopes.\n\nThe analysis framework I've created provides a systematic approach to overcome the data volume challenges while maintaining scientific rigor. This method can be applied to identify therapeutically relevant interactions and better understand viral-host molecular interactions.\n\nWould you like me to explore specific aspects of this analysis further, such as focusing on particular glycan types or lectin families?",

This is somewhat unusual for membrane proteins that traverse the secretory pathway, but could indicate:\n\n1. **Lack of experimental validation** of glycosylation sites\n2. **Species-specific differences** in glycosylation patterns\n3. **Functional adaptation** where these lectins don't require glycosylation for their cargo receptor function\n\n### **Post-Translational Modifications:**\nBoth proteins contain:\n- **Disulfide bonds:** EMP46 (Cys196-Cys230), EMP47 (Cys179-Cys213)\n- **Metal binding:** EMP46 has a potassium-binding site at Tyr177\n\n## Lectin-Protein Interactions and Functional Mechanisms\n\n### **Carbohydrate Recognition:**\n- Both lectins bind **D-mannose** and exhibit **carbohydrate binding activity**\n- They function as **Ca\u00b2\u207a-independent cargo receptors**\n- Critical for recognizing and sorting **glycoproteins** in the secretory pathway\n\n### **Protein-Protein Interactions:**\n1. **Heteromeric complex formation:** EMP46 and EMP47 interact with each other\n2. **COPI/COPII coat protein interactions:** Both interact with COP1, SEC21, and SEC23\n3. **ER-Golgi transport:** Essential for endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport\n\n### **Functional Significance:**\nThese lectins serve as **quality control checkpoints** in the secretory pathway by:\n- Recognizing properly folded glycoproteins through their carbohydrate modifications\n- Facilitating correct sorting and transport between ER and Golgi compartments\n- Contributing to cellular glycoprotein homeostasis\n\n## Subcellular Localization\n\nBoth proteins are found in:\n- **Endoplasmic reticulum membrane**\n- **Golgi apparatus membrane**\n- **COPII-coated ER to Golgi transport vesicles**\n\nThe **di-lysine motifs** (EMP46: 440-444, EMP47: 441-445) are crucial for their ER localization and interaction with coat proteins.\n\n## Clinical and Research Implications\n\nThese yeast lectins serve as important model systems for understanding:\n- **Glycoprotein quality control mechanisms**\n- **Intracellular lectin function**\n- **ER-Golgi trafficking processes**\n- **Evolution of carbohydrate recognition systems**\n\nThe absence of obvious glycosylation sites on these lectins themselves suggests they may represent a specialized class of carbohydrate-binding proteins that don't require glycosylation for their function, focusing instead on recognizing and sorting glycosylated cargo proteins.",
