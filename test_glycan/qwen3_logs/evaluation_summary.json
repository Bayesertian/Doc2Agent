While the agent correctly handled the API calls and interpreted the empty results, it did not achieve the research objective of retrieving protein features. The agent's reasoning about potential reasons for the lack of data was sound, but it did not provide any new insights or alternative solutions to address the research question effectively.\n\nCRITICAL_ISSUES: The agent did not retrieve any protein features, which was the primary objective of the task. The agent's approach did not yield the required data, and it did not explore further alternatives or databases that might have provided the needed information.\n\nSCIENTIFIC_ACCURACY: The scientific reasoning provided by the agent was accurate in terms of potential explanations for the lack of data, such as the possibility of the region being non-coding or lacking annotations. However, the agent did not provide any scientific insights or data relevant to glycomics research, as no features were retrieved.\n\nAPI_USAGE_ASSESSMENT: The agent used appropriate APIs and followed a logical workflow by first using the `get_feature_by_locations` API and then attempting the `search_genomic_coordinates` API. The agent correctly set parameters and interpreted the API responses. However, the agent did not explore additional resources or databases that might have provided the required data, which limited the effectiveness of its approach."
