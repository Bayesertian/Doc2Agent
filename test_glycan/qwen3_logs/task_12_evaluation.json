  "question": "What are the lectin fold and domain types of fungal lectins found in the species 'Candida albicans', with a focus on the first 100 results available in the UniLectin database?",
  "expected_trajectory": "get_fungal_lectins",
  "expected_answer": "The answer should return a list of entries detailing the fold and domain types alongside the species 'Candida albicans' for the first 100 fungal lectins found. The information should include each entry's fold type, domain type, and confirmed species classification.",

    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by retrieving and analyzing the lectin fold and domain types of fungal lectins from *Candida albicans* using the UniLectin database. The agent correctly identified the appropriate API (`get_fungal_lectins`) to obtain the necessary data, adjusted the parameters to focus on the species of interest, and set a limit of 100 results as requested. Although only 7 entries were available, the agent accurately reported this limitation and provided a detailed analysis of the available data. The agent's final response included a clear summary of the lectin folds and domains observed, along with an explanation of the limited data availability, which aligns with the research question.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is high. The agent correctly identified the lectin folds and domains from the retrieved data and provided meaningful insights into the distribution of these features among the entries. The interpretation of the data was accurate, and the agent's conclusions were valid within the context of the available dataset.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the appropriate API (`get_fungal_lectins`) and followed a logical workflow to address the research question. The agent demonstrated a good understanding of the API's parameters and effectively adjusted them to meet the task requirements. The agent also handled the limited data availability gracefully, providing a comprehensive analysis of the results obtained.",
