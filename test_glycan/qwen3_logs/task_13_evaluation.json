Initially, the agent attempted to use the `my_custom_mcp-compound_property_tables` function, which failed due to a parameter handling error. The agent then tried using Python code with the `pubchempy` library, but encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError` because the library was not installed. The agent's subsequent attempt to use the `my_custom_mcp-full_record_retrieval` function resulted in truncated data that was not directly useful for extracting the required properties. Finally, the agent successfully retrieved the data using the PubChem PUG REST API with the `requests` library, but this was not the expected API trajectory, and the agent did not provide a final answer within the `<FINISH></FINISH>` tags due to a context length error.",

    "scientific_accuracy": "The final data retrieved using the PubChem API was scientifically accurate, with correct molecular weights and SMILES for the compounds. However, the agent's reasoning about the relevance of these compounds to glycan-related processes was speculative and not directly supported by the data.",
