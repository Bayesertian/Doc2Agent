  "question": "What are the trefoil lectins found in the superkingdom of Bacteria analyzed by the domain, uniprot, and superkingdom fields? Retrieve a maximum of 2000 entries from the UniLectin database.",
  "expected_trajectory": "get_trefoil_lectins",
  "expected_answer": "The result should provide information about trefoil lectins including the domain of the lectin, the corresponding UniProt identifier, and the superkingdom classification. The data should specifically focus on entries matching the superkingdom of Bacteria, covering up to 2000 entries.",

    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by retrieving information about trefoil lectins in the Bacteria superkingdom from the UniLectin database. The agent used the `my_custom_mcp-get_trefoil_lectins` function, which aligns with the expected API trajectory. The agent correctly set the parameters to filter by the superkingdom \"Bacteria\" and requested the fields \"domain,\" \"uniprot,\" and \"superkingdom,\" with a limit of 2000 entries. The agent retrieved 2001 entries, slightly exceeding the limit, but this was acknowledged and explained in the final response. The agent provided a clear summary of the findings, highlighting the prevalence of the \"Ricin-like\" domain, the presence of a valid UniProt ID, and the confirmation that all entries belong to the Bacteria superkingdom. The agent's workflow was logical, and the conclusions drawn were appropriate for the research question.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific validity of the results is sound. The agent correctly interpreted the data fields and provided meaningful insights into the distribution of trefoil lectins in the Bacteria superkingdom. The mention of missing UniProt IDs and the focus on the \"Ricin-like\" domain are relevant observations for glycomics research.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the appropriate API function and set the parameters correctly to address the research question. The workflow was logical, starting with tool discovery and parameter setting, followed by data retrieval and analysis. The agent handled the slight excess in the number of entries gracefully and provided a comprehensive final answer.",
