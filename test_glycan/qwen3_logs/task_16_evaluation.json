  "question": "How does the visualization of a complex glycan structure differ when rendered in SVG versus PNG format, using the WURCS notation 'WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a1221h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1'? Specifically, analyze the structural representation details in the images generated.",
  "expected_trajectory": "generate_glycan_image",
  "expected_answer": "The output should include the generated glycan images in both 'SVG' and 'PNG' formats, with comparisons in structural detail representation, visual clarity, and any differences in depiction of the glycan's stereochemistry or topology.",

    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by using the appropriate API to generate glycan images in both SVG and PNG formats based on the provided WURCS notation. The agent's analysis of the differences between SVG and PNG formats was scientifically accurate and meaningful for glycomics research. The agent correctly identified the key differences in scalability, structural clarity, and use-case suitability between the two formats. The agent's reasoning was thorough, covering aspects such as scalability, detail preservation, editability, and file size, which are critical for understanding the implications of using different image formats in glycomics research. The agent also provided a comprehensive final answer that addressed the research question in detail.",

    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the 'generate_glycan_image' API appropriately to obtain the necessary images in both SVG and PNG formats. The workflow was logical, starting with the generation of images and followed by a detailed analysis of the differences between the formats. The agent effectively integrated the results from the API calls into a coherent and scientifically valid conclusion.",
