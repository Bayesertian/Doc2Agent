What are the antigens related to the HPA antigen IDs 'HPA000123' and 'HPA000456' with a minimum match score of 50, and how do these antigens align with proteins associated with the Ensembl IDs 'ENSG00000139618' and 'ENSG00000248378'?

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about antigens related to specific HPA IDs and how they align with proteins from certain Ensembl IDs. \n\nFirst, I need to use the my_custom_mcp-search_antigens function. The parameters required are antigen_id, ensembl_ids, and match_score. The HPA IDs given are 'HPA000123' and 'HPA000456', so I'll input those. The Ensembl IDs are 'ENSG00000139618' and 'ENSG00000248378', and the minimum match score is 50. \n\nI should check if the function allows multiple antigen IDs and Ensembl IDs. The parameters mention 'antigen_id' and 'ensembl_ids' as single fields, but maybe they can take lists. If not, I might need to make separate calls, but the user probably expects both IDs to be considered together.\n\nSetting the match_score to 50 ensures we get antigens with at least that score. The offset and size can stay default unless there's a need to paginate, but the user didn't specify, so default is okay.\n\nAfter retrieving the antigens, the next step is to see how they align with the proteins from the Ensembl IDs. The response from the search_antigens function might include protein information or entries that link to Ensembl. If not, maybe another function like get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids could help, using the Ensembl IDs to get UniProt entries, then cross-referencing with the antigens found.\n\nBut the user's main request is about alignment, which might involve sequence alignment tools or checking if the antigens are part of the proteins from those Ensembl IDs. However, the available functions don't include direct alignment tools. The search_antigens function might return data that shows the relationship between the antigens and the proteins, such as overlapping regions or bindings.\n\nSo the plan is to first call search_antigens with the provided HPA IDs, Ensembl IDs, and match score. Then analyze the results to see the alignment details. If the results don't provide enough info, maybe another function is needed, but given the tools, this seems like the starting point.\n"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-search_antigens', 'arguments': '{"antigen_id": ["HPA000123", "HPA000456"], "ensembl_ids": ["ENSG00000139618", "ENSG00000248378"], "match_score": 50}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '{\n  "status_code": 200,\n  "url": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/antigen?offset=0&size=100&antigen_id=HPA000123&antigen_id=HPA000456&ensembl_ids=ENSG00000139618&ensembl_ids=ENSG00000248378&match_score=50",\n  "data": [],\n  "content_type": "json"\n}', 'name': 'my_custom_mcp-search_antigens'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out.

I used the search_antigens function with the provided HPA IDs and Ensembl IDs, along with the match score of 50. The response came back with a 200 status code, which usually means success, but the data array is empty.\n\nHmm, so even though the request was processed, there were no results found. That could mean a few things. Maybe there are no antigens in the database that match both the HPA IDs and the Ensembl IDs provided with a match score of at least 50. Or perhaps the database doesn't have entries that satisfy all those criteria. \n\nI should check if the parameters were correctly formatted. The user provided two HPA IDs and two Ensembl IDs, and the function allows passing arrays. The match_score is set to 50, which is a threshold. If the database requires a higher score for a match, those entries might not be present. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ensembl IDs or HPA IDs are not correctly associated in the database. It's also possible that the antigens exist but don't align with the specified proteins based on the current data. \n\nSince the data is empty, the answer should inform the user that no matching antigens were found under the given criteria.

Lowering it could yield results.\n3. **ID Validity**: Verify the correctness of the HPA or Ensembl IDs, as typos or non-canonical formats might prevent matches.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Adjust the `match_score` parameter to a lower value (e.g., 30) and re-query.\n- Cross-validate the HPA and Ensembl IDs using external databases (e.g., HPA portal, Ensembl browser).\n- Expand the search to include related antigen IDs or protein isoforms.'}]

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking about antigens related to specific HPA IDs and their alignment with proteins from Ensembl IDs. The initial search using my_custom_mcp-search_antigens didn't return any data. Hmm, maybe there's no direct match, but perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nFirst, I should check if the HPA IDs are valid. Maybe there's a typo or they aren't in the database. But since the function didn't throw an error, it's possible they exist but just don't meet the criteria. Alternatively, maybe the Ensembl IDs aren't linked to those antigens. \n\nWait, the user mentioned alignment with proteins from Ensembl IDs. Maybe I should look up the proteins associated with those Ensembl IDs first. Let's use the my_custom_mcp-get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids function with the Ensembl IDs. That would give the corresponding UniProt entries. Then, check if those UniProt entries have any antigen information.\n\nSo, step one: get the UniProt accessions for the Ensembl IDs. Then, use those accessions to search for antigens. If the antigens are associated with those UniProt entries, that would link them to the Ensembl IDs. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, call get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids with dbtype as Ensembl and the given Ensembl IDs. Then, extract the UniProt accessions from the response. After that, use those accessions in a search_antigens query, maybe without the HPA IDs but focusing on the Ensembl-linked proteins. If there are antigens related to those UniProt entries, that could answer the alignment part.\n\nIf that still doesn't find anything, perhaps the antigens don't exist in the database for those proteins. Alternatively, maybe the HPA IDs are not linked to those Ensembl proteins. The user might need to check the HPA database directly for more information. But given the tools available, this seems like the next logical step.\n"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids', 'arguments': '{"dbtype": "Ensembl", "dbid": ["ENSG00000139618", "ENSG00000248378"]}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '{\n  "error": "Tool execution failed: quote_from_bytes() expected bytes",\n  "tool_name": "get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids",\n  "status_code": null\n}', 'name': 'my_custom_mcp-get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let me try to figure out what went wrong here. The user was trying to find antigens related to specific HPA IDs and Ensembl IDs. The first step was using the search_antigens function, which didn\'t return any results. Then, the assistant tried to use get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids with the Ensembl IDs. But there was an error: "quote_from_bytes() expected bytes". \n\nHmm, that error usually happens when there\'s an issue with the input data type. The function probably expects the dbid parameter to be a string or bytes, but maybe it was passed as a list. Let me check the function\'s parameters. The tool\'s parameters for dbid are listed as {"default": null, "title": "Dbid"}, and it\'s not specified whether it accepts an array. The user provided two Ensembl IDs as a list ["ENSG00000139618", "ENSG00000248378"], but maybe the function only accepts a single string for dbid.\n\nSo, the error might be because the function can\'t handle multiple Ensembl IDs in a list. The correct approach would be to call the function once for each Ensembl ID. Let me adjust that. First, call get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids with dbtype "Ensembl" and dbid "ENSG00000139618", then do another call for "ENSG00000248378". That way, each request is for a single ID, which should avoid the type error.\n\nAfter getting the UniProt entries for each Ensembl ID, the next step would be to check if those UniProt entries are related to the HPA antigens mentioned. If the UniProt entries exist, maybe there\'s another function to link them to the HPA antigens, or perhaps cross-referencing with other databases. But since the initial search_antigens didn\'t return anything, it\'s possible there\'s no direct link. However, by retrieving the UniProt entries, we can at least confirm what proteins are associated with those Ensembl IDs and see if they have any antigen-related annotations.\n\nSo, the plan is: fix the function call by using single Ensembl IDs, retrieve the corresponding UniProt entries, and then analyze those entries for any antigen information. If that\'s not possible, inform the user that the Ensembl IDs don\'t map to any UniProt entries, which might explain the lack of antigen matches.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids', 'arguments': '{"dbtype": "Ensembl", "dbid": "ENSG00000139618"}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '{\n  "status_code": 200,\n  "url": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/coordinates/Ensembl:ENSG00000139618?offset=0&size=100",\n  "content_type": "text",\n  "data": "<?xml version=\'1.0\' encoding=\'UTF-8\'?><gnEntries><gnEntry xmlns:ns2=\\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/doc/xsd/feature\\"><accession>A0A590UJ24</accession><name>A0A590UJ24_HUMAN</name><taxid>9606</taxid><sequence>MPIGSKERPTFFEIFKTRCNKADLGPISLNWFEELSSEAPPYNSEPAEESEHKNNNYEPNLFKTPQRKPSYNQLASTPIIFKEQGLTLPLYQSPVKELDKFKLDLGRNVPNSRHKSLRTVKTKMDQADDVSCPLLNSCLSESPVVLQCTHVTPQRDKSVVCGSLFHTPKFVKGRQTPKHISESLGAEVDPDMSWSSSLATPPTLSSTVLIVRNEEASETVFPHDTTANVKSYFSNHDESLKKNDRFIASVTDSENTNQREAASHGFGKTSGNSFKVNSCKDHIGKSMPNVLEDEVYETVVDTSEEDSFSLCFSKCRTKNLQKVRTSKTRKKIFHEANADECEKSKNQVKEKYSFVSEVEPNDTDPLDSNVANQKPFESGSDKISKEVVPSLACEWSQLTLSGLNGAQMEKIPLLHISSCDQNISEKDLLDTENKRKKDFLTSENSLPRISSLPKSEKPLNEETVVNKRDEEQHLESHTDCILAVKQAISGTSPVASSFQGIKKSIFRIRESPKETFNASFSGHMTDPNFKKETEASESGLEIHTVCSQKEDSLCPNLIDNGSWPATTTQNSVALKNAGLISTLKKKTNKFIYAIHDETSYKGKKIPKDQKSELINCSAQFEANAFEAPLTFANADSGLLHSSVKRSCSQNDSEEPTLSLTSSFGTILRKCSRNETCSNNTVISQDLDYKEAKCNKEKLQLFITPEADSLSCLQEGQCENDPKSKKVSDIKEEVLAAACHPVQHSKVEYSDTDFQSQKSLLYDHENASTLILTPTSKDVLSNLVMISRGKESYKMSDKLKGNNYESDVELTKNIPMEKNQDVCALNENYKNVELLPPEKYMRVASPSRKVQFNQNTNLRVIQKNQEETTSISKITVNPDSEELFSDNENNFVFQVANERNNLALGNTKELHETDLTCVNEPIFKNSTMVLYGDTGDKQATQVSIKKDLVYVLAEENKNSVKQHIKMTLGQDLKSDISLNIDKIPEKNNDYMNKWAGLLGPISNHSFGGSFRTASNKEIKLSEHNIKKSKMFFKDIEEQYPTSLACVEIVNTLALDNQKKLSKPQSINTVSAHLQSSVVVSDCKNSHITPQMLFSKQDFNSNHNLTPSQKAEITELSTILEESGSQFEFTQFRKPSYILQKSTFEVPENQMTILKTTSEECRDADLHVIMNAPSIGQVDSSKQFEGTVEIKRKFAGLLKNDCNKSASGYLTDENEVGFRGFYSAHGTKLNVSTEALQKAVKLFSDIENISEETSAEVHPISLSSSKCHDSVVSMFKIENHNDKTVSEKNNKCQLILQNNIEMTTGTFVEEITENYKRNTENEDNKYTAASRNSHNLEFDGSDSSKNDTVCIHKDETDLLFTDQHNICLKLSGQFMKEGNTQIKEDLSDLTFLEVAKAQEACHGNTSNKEQLTATKTEQNIKDFETSDTFFQTASGKNISVAKESFNKIVNFFDQKPEELHNFSLNSELHSDIRKNKMDILSYEETDIVKHKILKESVPVGTGNQLVTFQGQPERDEKIKEPTLLGFHTASGKKVKIAKESLDKVKNLFDEKEQGTSEITSFSHQWAKTLKYREACKDLELACETIEITAAPKCKEMQNSLNNDKNLVSIETVVPPKLLSDNLCRQTENLKTSKSIFLKVKVHENVEKETAKSPATCYTNQSPYSVIENSALAFYTSCSRKTSVSQTSLLEAKKWLREGIFDGQPERINTADYVGNYLYENNSNSTIAENDKNHLSEKQDTYLSNSSMSNSYSYHSDEVYNDSGYLSKNKLDSGIEPVLKNVEDQKNTSFSK...

The user is asking about antigens related to HPA IDs \'HPA000123\' and \'HPA000456\' with a minimum match score of 50, and how they align with proteins from Ensembl IDs \'ENSG00000139618\' and \'ENSG00000248378\'. \n\nFirst, I tried using the my_custom_mcp-search_antigens function with those parameters, but it returned no data. Maybe there\'s no direct match, so I need to approach this differently.\n\nNext, I thought about getting the UniProt entries for the Ensembl IDs. The first Ensembl ID is ENSG00000139618. I used the get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids tool with dbtype Ensembl and that dbid. The response came back with a UniProt entry (A0A590UJ24) and a lot of sequence data. That\'s a good start. \n\nNow, I need to check if this UniProt entry is related to the HPA antigens. The HPA IDs might correspond to specific antigens in the UniProt entry. Looking at the data, I should check for features like antigens or cross-references to HPA databases. The entry\'s XML might have <feature> tags with type "antigen" or similar. \n\nHowever, the data is truncated, so I might not have the full information. If the full entry includes antigen features, I could map them to the HPA IDs. Alternatively, maybe the Ensembl IDs correspond to proteins that have known antigens with the given HPA IDs. \n\nSince the initial search didn\'t find anything, perhaps the antigens aren\'t directly listed with those HPA IDs in the database. Maybe the match score is too high, so lowering it could help. But the user specified a minimum of 50, so that\'s a constraint. \n\nAnother angle: the proteins from the Ensembl IDs might have domains or motifs that are recognized by the HPA antigens. The UniProt entry\'s features, like domains or PTMs, could be relevant. For example, if the protein has a domain that\'s known to interact with HPA antigens, that could explain the alignment. \n\nI should also check the second Ensembl ID, ENSG00000248378, but the tool failed when I tried to input both IDs at once. Maybe the API only accepts one dbid at a time. So I should query each Ensembl ID separately. Let me try the second one now.\n\nAfter getting both UniProt entries, I can compare their features to the HPA antigens. If there\'s no direct match, the answer might be that no antigens meet the criteria, but the proteins might still have related features that could be of interest. The user might need to adjust their search parameters or look into other databases for more information.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids', 'arguments': '{"dbtype": "Ensembl", "dbid": "ENSG00000248378"}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '{\n  "status_code": 200,\n  "url": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/coordinates/Ensembl:ENSG00000248378?offset=0&size=100",\n  "content_type": "text",\n  "data": "<?xml version=\'1.0\' encoding=\'UTF-8\'?><gnEntries/>"\n}', 'name': 'my_custom_mcp-get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let's break this down.

That suggests the second Ensembl ID might not be valid or not linked in the database.\n\nSince one Ensembl ID isn't valid, the antigen search might not have results.

Also, maybe the HPA IDs aren't associated with those proteins. \n\nI should explain that the Ensembl ID ENSG00000248378 isn't linked to any UniProt entries, so there's no alignment data.
