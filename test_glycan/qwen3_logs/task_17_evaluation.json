  "question": "What are the antigens related to the HPA antigen IDs 'HPA000123' and 'HPA000456' with a minimum match score of 50, and how do these antigens align with proteins associated with the Ensembl IDs 'ENSG00000139618' and 'ENSG00000248378'?",
  "expected_trajectory": "search_antigens",
  "expected_answer": "The result will include a list of antigens with their UniProt accession numbers, antigen sequences, and related identifiers. For each antigen, the output will detail the alignment score and related protein sequence information based on the specified Human Protein Atlas antigen IDs and Ensembl IDs, filtered by a minimum match score of 50.",

    "reasoning": "The agent did not successfully complete the research task. The primary objective was to identify antigens related to specific HPA IDs and align them with proteins associated with given Ensembl IDs, filtered by a minimum match score of 50. The agent's approach involved using the `search_antigens` API, which returned no results, and then attempting to retrieve UniProt entries using the `get_uniprot_entries_by_genomic_database_cross_reference_ids` API. However, the agent encountered an error due to incorrect handling of input data types, which was not resolved effectively. The agent's final response did not provide the expected list of antigens with alignment details, and the reasoning did not adequately address the scientific context or provide meaningful insights into the protein-glycan interactions.",
    "critical_issues": "1. The agent failed to handle the API error related to input data types effectively, which prevented successful retrieval of UniProt entries for both Ensembl IDs. 2. The agent did not provide a complete answer to the research question, as it did not retrieve or analyze the required antigen data. 3. The agent's reasoning lacked depth in exploring alternative approaches or tools that could have been used to achieve the research objective.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is questionable due to the lack of meaningful data retrieval and analysis. The agent did not demonstrate a proper understanding of protein-glycan interactions or the significance of the HPA and Ensembl IDs in the context of glycomics research.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent's API usage was inappropriate due to the failure to handle input data types correctly and the lack of a logical workflow progression. The agent did not effectively integrate data from multiple API calls or synthesize results from different sources. The agent's approach did not align with glycomics best practices, as it did not start with appropriate tool discovery or handle errors gracefully.",
