    "reasoning": "The agent failed to successfully complete the research task due to several critical issues in API usage and scientific accuracy. The agent attempted to use the `my_custom_mcp-get_natural_variants_by_hgvs_expression` API to find natural variants associated with the specified gene variation. However, the agent encountered multiple errors related to incorrect parameter values and formatting issues. Initially, the agent used incorrect values for the `consequencetype` and `sourcetype` parameters, which led to a 400 error. After correcting these parameters, the agent received a 200 status code but with an empty data array, indicating no results were found. The agent then attempted to adjust the query by removing the `sourcetype` parameter, but this resulted in a validation error due to incorrect argument formatting. Ultimately, the agent concluded that no variants were found, but this conclusion was based on incomplete and incorrect API usage rather than a thorough investigation.",
    "critical_issues": "1. Incorrect parameter values for `consequencetype` and `sourcetype` initially led to a 400 error. 2. Validation error due to incorrect argument formatting when attempting to adjust the query. 3. Lack of exploration of alternative approaches or databases to verify the absence of variants.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is questionable because the agent did not successfully retrieve any data. The conclusion that no variants were found is not scientifically valid without a comprehensive search across relevant databases and proper API usage.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent did not use the API appropriately, as evidenced by the initial parameter errors and subsequent validation error. The agent's workflow lacked logical progression, and there was no meaningful synthesis of results due to the failure to retrieve any data. The agent also did not explore alternative methods or databases to cross-reference the variant, which would have been a logical step given the lack of results from the initial API calls.",
