  "question": "How are the genomic coordinates of the genes BRCA1 and TP53 distributed across different chromosomes in Homo sapiens (taxid: 9606), and how can this information be accessed in JSON format for further validation against known genomic databases?",
  "expected_trajectory": "search_genomic_coordinates",
  "expected_answer": "The tool will return genomic coordinate information in JSON format for the UniProt gene entries BRCA1 and TP53. The response will include details such as the chromosome number, genome start and end positions, and associated UniProt accessions, allowing researchers to verify the gene distribution and compare it with existing genomic databases.",

    "decision": "FAILURE",

    "reasoning": "The agent failed to complete the research task due to an error related to exceeding the model's maximum context length. This error prevented the agent from retrieving and providing the genomic coordinates of the BRCA1 and TP53 genes in JSON format, as requested. The task required accessing genomic data, which is not directly related to glycomics but rather to genomics. The agent did not make any API calls or attempt to access genomic databases, which would have been necessary to obtain the required information. The error message indicates a technical issue rather than a scientific or methodological one, but it still resulted in the task not being completed.",
    "critical_issues": "The primary issue was the technical error related to exceeding the model's context length, which prevented any progress on the task. Additionally, there was no attempt to use any APIs or databases to retrieve the genomic information.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "Not applicable, as no scientific data or results were obtained due to the error.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent did not use any APIs or follow a logical workflow to address the research question. The expected trajectory involved using genomic databases or APIs to retrieve the genomic coordinates of the specified genes, but this was not attempted. The task was not aligned with glycomics, and the agent did not adapt to the genomic context of the question.",
