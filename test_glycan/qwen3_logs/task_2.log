How many reviewed UniProt entries exist for the protein 'Glycosyltransferase' in the organism 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae' (taxid 559292), with a sequence length between 400 and 800 amino acids and associated with the Gene Ontology term 'GO:0005975' (carbohydrate metabolic process)?

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let\'s tackle this query step by step. The user is asking for the number of reviewed UniProt entries for Glycosyltransferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (taxid 559292) with a sequence length between 400 and 800 amino acids and associated with the GO term \'GO:0005975\'.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which function to use. The available functions include search_uniprot_entries, which allows searching UniProt entries with various filters. Let me check the parameters of that function.\n\nThe search_uniprot_entries function has parameters like organism (organism), taxid, goterms, and seqLength. The user specified the organism as Saccharomyces cerevisiae with taxid 559292, so I can set taxid to 559292. The GO term is \'GO:0005975\', so the goterms parameter should include that. For the sequence length, the user wants between 400 and 800, so seqLength can be set to a range like "400-800". Also, the protein name is Glycosyltransferase, but the function\'s parameters don\'t have a direct field for protein name. However, the \'protein\' parameter might allow searching by protein name. \n\nWait, looking at the parameters for search_uniprot_entries, there\'s a \'protein\' parameter. So I can set protein to \'Glycosyltransferase\'. Also, since they want reviewed entries, the \'reviewed\' parameter should be set to true. \n\nPutting this all together: reviewed=true, protein=Glycosyltransferase, taxid=559292, goterms=\'GO:0005975\', seqLength=\'400-800\'. The function should return the entries matching these criteria, and then we can count them. \n\nI need to make sure that all the parameters are correctly formatted. The \'goterms\' parameter might accept a list, but the user provided a single term. The \'seqLength\' as a range is acceptable. Also, the \'protein\' parameter might match entries containing that keyword in the protein name. \n\nI think this should work. Let\'s call the search_uniprot_entries function with these parameters and then count the results. If the function returns a list of entries, the count would be the number of entries in that list.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-search_uniprot_entries', 'arguments': '{"reviewed": true, "protein": "Glycosyltransferase", "taxid": "559292", "goterms": "GO:0005975", "seqLength": "400-800"}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '{\n  "status_code": 200,\n  "url": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/proteins?offset=0&size=100&reviewed=True&goterms=GO%3A0005975&protein=Glycosyltransferase&taxid=559292&seqLength=400-800",\n  "content_type": "text",\n  "data": "<?xml version=\'1.0\' encoding=\'UTF-8\'?><uniprot xmlns=\\"http://uniprot.org/uniprot\\" xsi:schemaLocation=\\"http://uniprot.org/uniprot http://www.uniprot.org/support/docs/uniprot.xsd\\" xmlns:xsi=\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\\"/>"\n}', 'name': 'my_custom_mcp-search_uniprot_entries'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to answer the user\'s question based on the tool response provided. The user asked for the number of reviewed UniProt entries for Glycosyltransferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (taxid 559292) with a sequence length between 400 and 800 amino acids and associated with GO:0005975.\n\nFirst, the tool call was made using the search_uniprot_entries function with the specified parameters. The response came back with a status code of 200, which means the request was successful. The URL indicates that the search was performed with the correct parameters: reviewed=True, goterms=GO:0005975, protein=Glycosyltransferase, taxid=559292, and seqLength=400-800. \n\nHowever, looking at the data returned, it\'s an empty XML tag. That suggests that the query didn\'t find any entries matching those criteria. The UniProt XML response is structured, so if there were results, they would be listed within the <uniprot> tags. Since there\'s nothing inside, it means no entries met all the specified conditions.\n\nI need to check if there\'s a possibility of an error in the query parameters. For example, maybe the taxid is incorrect or the GO term isn\'t associated with any entries. But the user provided the taxid as 559292 for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is correct. The GO term GO:0005975 is "carbohydrate metabolic process," which is a valid term. \n\nAnother angle is that the sequence length range might be too restrictive. Maybe there are no reviewed entries for Glycosyltransferase in yeast with lengths between 400-800 amino acids. Alternatively, perhaps the protein name "Glycosyltransferase" isn\'t matching any reviewed entries exactly. Sometimes, the protein name might be more specific, like "UDP-glucose 4-epimerase" instead of a general term like Glycosyltransferase.\n\nThe user might need to consider using a broader search term or checking the exact protein names in UniProt. Also, verifying the GO term associations for the entries of interest could help. If the response is indeed empty, the answer would be zero entries found. The user should also check if there are any entries in UniProt for that organism and GO term by adjusting the parameters.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\n\nThe search for reviewed UniProt entries matching the criteria (protein name "Glycosyltransferase", organism *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* [taxid 559292], sequence length 400-800, and GO term "GO:0005975") returned **0 results**. The XML response is empty, indicating no entries satisfy all these conditions.\n\n### Possible next steps:\n1. **Verify protein name specificity**: "Glycosyltransferase" is a broad term. Try more specific names (e.g., "UDP-glucose 4-epimerase" or "GlcNAc transferase").\n2. **Check GO term relevance**: Ensure "GO:0005975" is actively annotated to yeast glycosyltransferases.\n3. **Adjust sequence length range**: Expand the range (e.g., 300-900) to capture more entries.\n4. **Remove filters**: Test the query without the `seqLength` or `goterms` parameters to identify baseline matches.\n\nWould you like help refining the search?'}]
