However, the agent's approach was flawed in several ways: 1. **API Usage Appropriateness**: The agent used the `my_custom_mcp-convert_composition_text_to_wurcs_format` function to convert the glycan composition to WURCS format, which was appropriate. However, the subsequent use of `my_custom_mcp-obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs` did not yield a GlyTouCan ID, and the agent did not explore alternative methods or validate the WURCS string further. 2. **Scientific Accuracy**: The WURCS string provided by the agent appears to be syntactically correct, but the agent did not verify its accuracy or completeness. The agent also failed to provide a GlyTouCan ID, which was a critical part of the research question. 3. **Completeness**: The agent did not fully complete the task as it failed to provide the GlyTouCan ID. The response \"Accession not found\" was not adequately addressed, and the agent did not explore other potential solutions or verify the composition's accuracy. 4. **Data Integration**: The agent did not effectively integrate the results from the API calls. The lack of a GlyTouCan ID was not resolved, and the agent did not attempt to find similar structures or verify the WURCS string. 5. **Research Workflow**: The agent's workflow was not consistent with glycomics best practices. It did not handle the \"Accession not found\" error gracefully and did not explore alternative approaches or validate the WURCS string.",
