  "question": "What protein sequence features related to glycosylation can be identified in reviewed proteins of human hemoglobin (Homo sapiens) using the UniProt accession numbers P69905 and P68871? Consider only features categorized under POST_TRANSLATIONAL_MODIFICATIONS and types inclusive of CARBOHYD.",
  "expected_trajectory": "search_protein_sequence_features",
  "expected_answer": "The output should include protein sequence features specifically for the reviewed human hemoglobin proteins (accessions: P69905 and P68871), categorized under POST_TRANSLATIONAL_MODIFICATIONS, with a focus on the CARBOHYD type. The information should highlight the positions of glycosylation sites, types of carbohydrate modifications, and relevant feature descriptions.",

    "reasoning": "The agent did not successfully complete the research task due to a critical error that prevented it from retrieving any information. The task required identifying glycosylation-related protein sequence features in human hemoglobin using specific UniProt accession numbers. However, the agent encountered a \"BadRequestError\" due to exceeding the model's maximum context length, which halted the process before any meaningful data retrieval or analysis could occur. As a result, the agent did not perform any API calls or data integration, and no scientific conclusions were drawn.",

    "scientific_accuracy": "Not applicable, as no scientific data was retrieved or analyzed due to the error.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent did not use any APIs due to the error encountered. Therefore, there was no opportunity to assess the appropriateness of API usage or the logical workflow. The task was not initiated beyond the initial request, and no API calls were made to search for protein sequence features related to glycosylation. Overall, the agent's performance was hindered by a technical error, and it did not progress to any stage where scientific analysis or API usage could be evaluated.",
