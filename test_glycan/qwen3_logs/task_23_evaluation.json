  "question": "Can we identify and compare the structural folds and domains of fungal lectins found in the species 'Aspergillus niger'? Use the UniLectin database to retrieve data by focusing on the 'fold', 'domain', and 'species' columns. Limit the results to 1000 entries to ensure manageability of data analysis.",
  "expected_trajectory": "get_fungal_lectins",
  "expected_answer": "The response should include information on the structural folds and domains identified for fungal lectins associated with the species 'Aspergillus niger'. Specifically, the data returned should focus on the structural characteristics by listing the 'fold', 'domain', and 'species' for each entry, limited to a maximum of 1000 entries.",

    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by retrieving and analyzing data on the structural folds and domains of fungal lectins in *Aspergillus niger* using the UniLectin database. The agent correctly used the `my_custom_mcp-get_fungal_lectins` API to obtain the necessary data, focusing on the 'fold', 'domain', and 'species' columns, and limited the results to 1000 entries as requested. The agent provided a clear summary of the structural diversity observed in the sample data, highlighting four distinct fold-domain combinations. The analysis included meaningful biological insights into the potential functions of these structures, such as their roles in host-pathogen interactions and environmental adaptation. The agent also acknowledged the limitations of the sample size and suggested further steps for comprehensive analysis, demonstrating a logical research workflow consistent with glycomics best practices.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific validity of the results is strong. The agent accurately interpreted the structural data and provided reasonable biochemical reasoning for the observed diversity in lectin folds and domains. The discussion of potential functional implications was appropriate and aligned with current understanding in glycomics research.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the appropriate API to retrieve the necessary data and followed a logical workflow. The function call parameters were correctly set to focus on the specified columns and species, and the agent effectively synthesized the results into a coherent analysis. The agent's approach was scientifically valid and aligned with the research question.",
