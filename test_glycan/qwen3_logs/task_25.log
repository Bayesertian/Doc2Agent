[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let\'s tackle this query. The user wants to investigate proteomics peptide data for two human proteins linked to Alzheimer\'s: P05067 (Amyloid beta A4) and Q9Y6Q9 (Presenilin-1). They specifically want peptides from the MaxQB database and ensure the peptides are unique to their gene groups.\n\nFirst, I need to recall which function can handle this. The available tools include my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptides. Let me check its parameters. The function allows specifying accessions, taxid, datasource, and unique status. \n\nThe user mentioned MaxQB, so I should set datasource to "MaxQB". The accessions are provided, so I\'ll include them in an array. To ensure uniqueness, the \'unique\' parameter should be set to "true". Taxid for humans is 9606. \n\nWait, the parameters for the function: the \'accession\' field accepts a string or array. So I can input both P05067 and Q9Y6Q9. The \'unique\' parameter is a string, so setting it to "true" should filter unique peptides. Also, taxid 9606 ensures we\'re looking at human proteins. \n\nI need to structure the tool call correctly. The function name is my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptides. The arguments should include "accession": ["P05067", "Q9Y6Q9"], "taxid": "9606", "datasource": "MaxQB", and "unique": "true". \n\nDouble-checking if all required parameters are met. The function doesn\'t have required parameters, but to fulfill the user\'s request, those mentioned are necessary. This setup should retrieve the desired peptide data from MaxQB for those accessions, ensuring uniqueness.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptides', 'arguments': '{"accession": ["P05067", "Q9Y6Q9"], "taxid": "9606", "datasource": "MaxQB", "unique": "true"}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '{\n  "status_code": 200,\n  "url": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/proteomics?offset=0&size=100&accession=P05067%2CQ9Y6Q9&taxid=9606&datasource=MaxQB&unique=true",\n  "data": [],\n  "content_type": "json"\n}', 'name': 'my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptides'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let me try to figure out what\'s going on here. The user asked to investigate proteomics peptide data for two UniProt accessions related to Alzheimer\'s disease, specifically P05067 (Amyloid beta A4) and Q9Y6Q9 (Presenilin-1), using the MaxQB database and ensuring peptides are unique to their gene groups.\n\nI called the my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptides function with the parameters: accessions as ["P05067", "Q9Y6Q9"], taxid 9606 (human), datasource MaxQB, and unique set to true. The response came back with a 200 status but an empty data array. Hmm, that\'s unexpected. \n\nFirst, I should check if the parameters were correctly formatted. The URL in the response shows the accessions are URL-encoded as P05067%2CQ9Y6Q9, which should be correct. The taxid is 9606, which is right for humans. The datasource is MaxQB, which the user specified. Unique is set to true, so it should return only unique peptides per gene.\n\nBut the data array is empty. Maybe there are no peptides in MaxQB for these accessions under those conditions? Or perhaps the API expects different parameters. Let me think: maybe the \'unique\' parameter isn\'t a boolean but requires a different format? The function\'s parameters list \'unique\' as a string or null, defaulting to null. The user wanted peptides unique to their gene groups, so setting unique=true makes sense. But maybe the API doesn\'t support that parameter or requires it to be part of another query.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is with the accessions. Let me verify if P05067 and Q9Y6Q9 are correct. P05067 is APP (Amyloid beta A4), which is correct. Q9Y6Q9 is indeed Presenilin-1. So the accessions are valid.\n\nAnother angle: the MaxQB database might not have entries for these specific peptides under the given conditions. The user might need to check if there\'s data available. Alternatively, perhaps the API requires different filtering. Maybe increasing the size parameter beyond 100? But the default is 100, and the response didn\'t mention pagination. However, the user didn\'t specify a need for more than 100, so maybe that\'s not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function isn\'t the right one. The user asked for peptides associated with Alzheimer\'s, but the function is a general proteomics search. Perhaps there\'s a need to filter by disease, but the function parameters don\'t include that. The current function doesn\'t have a disease parameter, so that\'s a limitation.\n\nIn the absence of data, I should inform the user that no results were found with the current parameters and suggest possible reasons, like checking the database for availability, verifying the parameters, or considering alternative approaches if disease-specific filtering is needed.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\n\nThe query to the UniProt proteomics peptides API with the specified parameters (accessions `P05067` and `Q9Y6Q9`, taxid `9606`, datasource `MaxQB`, and `unique=true`) returned an empty result set. This could indicate one of the following:\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Explanations**\n1. **No Data in MaxQB for These Accessions**  \n   The MaxQB database might not contain peptide data for the specified UniProt accessions under the given conditions. This could be due to limited experimental coverage or filtering criteria.\n\n2. **Parameter Constraints**  \n   - The `unique=true` filter might be too restrictive, excluding all peptides if they are not uniquely mapped to the specified genes.\n   - The default `size=100` might not be sufficient if the results are paginated. Try increasing the `size` parameter (e.g., `size=500`).\n\n3. **API Limitations**  \n   The API might not support disease-specific (Alzheimer\'s) filtering directly. The current query focuses on gene-specific peptides but does not explicitly tie them to Alzheimer\'s pathology.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Verify Accessions and Datasource**  \n   Confirm that `P05067` (APP/Amyloid-beta) and `Q9Y6Q9` (Presenilin-1) are correctly associated with Alzheimer\'s in the MaxQB database. Use tools like UniProt or MaxQB\'s website to cross-check.\n\n2. **Adjust Parameters**  \n   Try removing the `unique=true` filter or increasing the `size` parameter:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "accession": ["P05067", "Q9Y6Q9"],\n     "taxid": "9606",\n     "datasource": "MaxQB",\n     "size": 500\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Disease-Specific Filtering**  \n   If the API allows, add disease-related terms (e.g., "Alzheimer") to the query. Since the current function does not support this, consider using the `my_custom_mcp-search_uniprot_entries` function to pre-filter Alzheimer\'s-associated proteins before querying peptides.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Follow-Up Query**\nIf you suspect the `unique` filter is causing the issue, try:\n```json\n{\n  "name": "my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptides",\n  "arguments": {\n    "accession": ["P05067", "Q9Y6Q9"],\n    "taxid": "9606",\n    "datasource": "MaxQB",\n    "size": 500\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLet me know if you\'d like to proceed!'}]

Round 2 - ASSISTANT

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let\'s see. The user is trying to find proteomics peptide data for two specific UniProt accessions related to Alzheimer\'s disease. They used the my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptides function with certain parameters, but the response was empty. Now I need to figure out why and how to resolve it.\n\nFirst, the initial query had accessions P05067 and Q9Y6Q9, taxid 9606, datasource MaxQB, and unique set to true. The API returned a 200 but no data. Possible reasons could be that the data isn\'t present in MaxQB for those accessions, the parameters are too restrictive, or there\'s an issue with the API call.\n\nThe assistant suggested removing the unique filter or increasing the size. Let\'s try removing the unique parameter first. Maybe the unique constraint is causing no results. Also, increasing the size from 100 to a higher number might help if the data exists beyond the first 100 entries.\n\nSo, the next step is to adjust the parameters: keep the same accessions and taxid, set datasource to MaxQB, and remove unique. Also, maybe increase the size to 500 to get more results. Let\'s call the function again with these changes.\n\nIf this still returns no data, perhaps check if the accessions are correct. Confirm that these UniProt IDs are indeed associated with Alzheimer\'s in MaxQB. Alternatively, maybe the MaxQB database doesn\'t have entries for these proteins. The user might need to use a different database or check directly on MaxQB\'s website.\n\nAnother angle: the function\'s parameters might require different formatting. For example, maybe the accessions need to be a string separated by commas instead of an array. The URL in the previous response showed "accession=P05067%2CQ9Y6Q9", which is correct. So the array should be fine.\n\nIf the second attempt still fails, the conclusion might be that there\'s no data available in MaxQB for those accessions under the given conditions. The user could then consider other databases or expand their search criteria.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptides', 'arguments': '{"accession": ["P05067", "Q9Y6Q9"], "taxid": "9606", "datasource": "MaxQB", "size": 500}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '{\n  "status_code": 200,\n  "url": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/proteomics?offset=0&size=500&accession=P05067%2CQ9Y6Q9&taxid=9606&datasource=MaxQB",\n  "data": [],\n  "content_type": "json"\n}', 'name': 'my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptides'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let's see.

Alternatively, the API might not support the parameters as used. The user might need to check directly on the MaxQB website or use another database. Also, the absence of data could mean that the peptides for these proteins aren't documented in MaxQB, or the query needs a different approach, like using different filters or a larger size. But since increasing the size didn't help, it's possible there's no data available here.
