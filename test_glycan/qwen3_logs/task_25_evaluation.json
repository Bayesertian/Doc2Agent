  "question": "Investigate the proteomics peptide data for human proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease under the UniProt accessions 'P05067' (Amyloid beta A4 protein) and 'Q9Y6Q9' (Presenilin-1). Focus on peptides identified in the MaxQB database. Ensure that the peptides are unique to their respective gene groups.",

  "expected_answer": {
    "description": "The response should include proteomics peptide data from the UniProt database for the specified human proteins. The data should filter for unique peptides that are recorded in the MaxQB database. The information should cover details on peptide sequences, their associated taxa (Homo sapiens), and confirming their classification within unique gene groups. The results will provide insights into the proteomic profile of Alzheimer's-related proteins identified in a specific proteomics data source.",

The agent correctly identified and used the `my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptides` function, which aligns with the expected API trajectory. However, the agent's attempts to retrieve data resulted in empty responses, indicating a failure to obtain the required information. The agent did not explore alternative databases or methods to verify the absence of data in MaxQB, nor did it provide a comprehensive analysis of potential reasons for the lack of data. The agent's final response did not include any peptide sequences or confirm their uniqueness, which were key components of the research question.",
