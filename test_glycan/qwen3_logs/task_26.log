[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let\'s tackle this query. The user wants to investigate phosphorylation in PGK1 across humans and mice, using specific UniProt accessions and data sources with a Gold confidence score.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions are available. The user provided a list of tools. Let me scan through them. There\'s a function called my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptide_ptm which seems relevant because it\'s about PTMs. The parameters include accession, datasource, and confidence_score. \n\nThe user specified the UniProt accessions: P00558 for human and P52480 for mouse. The data sources are PRIDE and PTMExchange, and the confidence score should be Gold. \n\nSo, I need to call the search_proteomics_peptide_ptm function twice, once for each accession. Wait, but can I input both accessions in one call? The parameters for accession allow an array, so maybe I can pass both. Let me check the function\'s parameters again. The \'accession\' parameter is described as "anyOf" which includes an array. So, I can include both P00558 and P52480 in the same request. \n\nThe datasource should be set to ["PRIDE", "PTMExchange"], and the confidence_score to "Gold". Also, the function requires the \'accession\' parameter, which I have. The other parameters like taxid or upid aren\'t needed here. \n\nWait, the function\'s required parameters are \'accession\', which I have. The other parameters are optional. So the tool call should include the accessions, datasources, and confidence score. \n\nI should structure the tool call with these parameters. Let me make sure the JSON is correctly formatted. The name of the function is my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptide_ptm, and the arguments should include the accessions as an array, datasource as an array with PRIDE and PTMExchange, and confidence_score as "Gold". \n\nYes, that should retrieve the phosphorylation data for both species from the specified sources with the required confidence level.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptide_ptm', 'arguments': '{"accession": ["P00558", "P52480"], "datasource": ["PRIDE", "PTMExchange"], "confidence_score": "Gold"}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '{\n  "status_code": 200,\n  "url": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/people/person/henning-hermjakob/?size=100&accession=P00558&accession=P52480&datasource=PRIDE&datasource=PTMExchange&confidence_score=Gold",\n  "content_type": "text",\n  "data": "<!doctype html><html lang=\\"en\\" class=\\"vf-no-js\\">\\n  <head>\\n    <script>\\n// Detect if JS is on and swap vf-no-js for vf-js on the html element\\n(function(H){H.className=H.className.replace(/\\\\bvf-no-js\\\\b/,\'vf-js\')})(document.documentElement);\\n</script>\\n\\n    <meta charset=\\"utf-8\\">\\n    <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\">\\n    <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" media=\\"all\\" href=\\"/people/css/styles.css?\\" />\\n    <title>Henning Hermjakob, Head of Molecular Systems | People | EMBLâ\x80\x99s European Bionformatics Institute</title>\\n    <link rel=\\"shortcut icon\\" href=\\"https://assets.emblstatic.net/vf/v2.5.0/assets/embl-favicon/assets/favicon.ico\\">\\n<link rel=\\"apple-touch-icon\\" sizes=\\"180x180\\" href=\\"https://assets.emblstatic.net/vf/v2.5.0/assets/embl-favicon/assets/apple-touch-icon.png\\">\\n<link rel=\\"icon\\" type=\\"image/png\\" sizes=\\"32x32\\" href=\\"https://assets.emblstatic.net/vf/v2.5.0/assets/embl-favicon/assets/favicon-32x32.png\\">\\n<link rel=\\"icon\\" type=\\"image/png\\" sizes=\\"16x16\\" href=\\"https://assets.emblstatic.net/vf/v2.5.0/assets/embl-favicon/assets/favicon-16x16.png\\">\\n<link rel=\\"manifest\\" href=\\"https://assets.emblstatic.net/vf/v2.5.0/assets/embl-favicon/assets/site.webmanifest\\">\\n<link rel=\\"mask-icon\\" href=\\"https://assets.emblstatic.net/vf/v2.5.0/assets/embl-favicon/assets/safari-pinned-tab.svg\\" color=\\"#ffffff\\">\\n<meta name=\\"msapplication-TileColor\\" content=\\"#ffffff\\">\\n<meta name=\\"theme-color\\" content=\\"#ffffff\\">\\n\\n\\n    <!-- Search indexing optimisations -->\\n    <meta class=\\"swiftype\\" name=\\"what\\" data-type=\\"string\\" content=\\"People directory\\" />\\n    <meta class=\\"swiftype\\" name=\\"where\\" data-type=\\"string\\" content=\\"\\" />\\n    \\n\\n    <!-- Descriptive meta -->\\n    <meta name=\\"title\\" content=\\"Henning Hermjakob, Head of Molecular Systems | People | EMBLâ\x80\x99s European Bionformatics Institute\\">\\n    <meta name=\\"author\\" content=\\"EMBLâ\x80\x99s European Bionformatics Institute\\">\\n    <meta name=\\"robots\\" content=\\"index, follow\\">\\n    <meta name=\\"keywords\\" content=\\"EMBL-EBI, people, staff, visitors\\">...

The user asked about phosphorylation in PGK1 for humans and mice, using specific UniProt accessions and data sources. The tool call was made, but the response seems to be an HTML page about Henning Hermjakob, which doesn't relate to the query. That's odd. Maybe the API endpoint is incorrect or there's a redirect issue. The URL in the tool response includes parameters like accession and datasource, but it's pointing to a person's page. This suggests a possible error in the API request. I need to check if the function parameters are correctly formatted. The function 'my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptide_ptm' was used with accessions P00558 and P52480, datasources PRIDE and PTMExchange, and confidence score Gold. The URL constructed might have a typo or incorrect path. Alternatively, maybe the EBI API isn't handling the parameters as expected. The user probably needs the actual PTM data, but the current response isn't providing it. I should inform the user about the discrepancy and suggest verifying the API endpoint or parameters.\n"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\n\nIt appears there was an issue with the API request.

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let's try to figure out what went wrong here. The user wanted information on phosphorylation in PGK1 for humans and mice using specific UniProt IDs and data sources. The first tool call was made, but the response was an HTML page about a person, which is clearly not the right data.\n\nHmm, maybe the API endpoint in the tool is incorrect. The URL in the tool response points to a person's page at EMBL-EBI. That suggests that the parameters passed might not be correctly formatted or the endpoint is wrong. Let me check the function parameters again. The function 'my_custom_mcp-search_proteomics_peptide_ptm' requires 'accession', 'datasource', and 'confidence_score'. The user provided all these, but perhaps the way they're formatted in the URL is causing a redirect.\n\nAnother possibility is that the EBI API isn't handling the parameters as expected. Maybe the parameters need to be URL-encoded differently or the API path is incorrect. For example, the URL includes query parameters like 'accession' and 'datasource', but if the API expects these in a different format, it might not process them correctly, leading to a default page being served.\n\nSince the tool response didn't return the expected PTM data, the next step is to inform the user about the issue. They might need to check the API documentation to ensure the parameters are correct. Alternatively, there could be a temporary server issue. But given that the response was a personnel page, it's more likely a misconfiguration in the tool's API endpoint.\n\nI should explain the possible reasons and suggest alternative approaches. Maybe recommend using a different API or tool that can access the required PTM data. For example, UniProt's own API or another database like PhosphoSitePlus. Also, explain how to interpret the confidence scores if they need that information.\n\nIn the final answer, I need to summarize the problem, suggest possible solutions, and offer to help further if they want to try a different method.\n"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\n\n<FINISH>\nThe investigation into phosphorylation of PGK1 (UniProt P00558 for human and P52480 for mouse) using the specified data sources (PRIDE, PTMExchange) and Gold confidence score encountered an unexpected issue. The API request redirected to a personnel page instead of returning PTM data, indicating a likely misconfiguration in the tool\'s API endpoint or parameter handling.\n\n**Recommendations for next steps:**\n1. **Verify API Endpoint:** Confirm the correct URL structure for the `search_proteomics_peptide_ptm` function. The current implementation appears to route requests to an unrelated EMBL-EBI personnel page.\n2. **Alternative Data Sources:** Use UniProt\'s direct PTM interface or databases like PhosphoSitePlus for phosphorylation data. Example UniProt URLs:\n   - Human PGK1: [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00558#ptm_processing](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00558#ptm_processing)\n   - Mouse PGK1: [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P52480#ptm_processing](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P52480#ptm_processing)\n3. **Parameter Validation:** Ensure parameters like `datasource` and `confidence_score` match the API\'s expected format (e.g., exact enumeration of allowed values).\n\n**Gold Confidence Score Context:** In PTM databases, "Gold" typically indicates high-confidence evidence from multiple independent experiments or orthogonal methodologies. If you\'d like, I can help formulate a UniProt API query to retrieve this information programmatically using a working endpoint.'}]
