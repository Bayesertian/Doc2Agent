  "question": "What are the detailed chemical properties, biological associations, classifications, and cross-references of the glycan with GlyTouCan accession number 'G01543ZX'? Use the glycan_detail tool to gather comprehensive details for potential research on glycan biological roles and interactions.",
  "expected_trajectory": "glycan_detail",
  "expected_answer": "The response should include detailed information about the glycan with GlyTouCan accession number 'G01543ZX', focusing on chemical properties such as molecular weight and structure, biological associations including involved pathways or organisms, classifications based on glycan types, and any significant cross-references with databases or external resources.",

    "reasoning": "The agent failed to complete the research task due to an error encountered during the API call. The error message indicates that the request exceeded the model's maximum context length, resulting in a BadRequestError. This prevented the agent from retrieving any information about the glycan with GlyTouCan accession number 'G01543ZX'. Consequently, the agent did not provide any details on the chemical properties, biological associations, classifications, or cross-references of the glycan, which were the core components of the research question.",
    "critical_issues": "1. The agent did not handle the API error effectively, leading to a complete lack of response to the research question. 2. There was no attempt to adjust the request or retry with a reduced context length, which could have potentially resolved the issue.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "Not applicable, as no scientific data was retrieved or presented due to the API error.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent attempted to use the glycan_detail tool, which is appropriate for the task. However, the agent did not manage the API call effectively, as evidenced by the failure to handle the context length error. There was no evidence of a logical workflow or error recovery strategy, such as breaking down the request into smaller parts or consulting documentation to address the error. Overall, the agent's performance was inadequate due to the failure to retrieve any information and the lack of error management, which are critical for successful completion of the research task.",
