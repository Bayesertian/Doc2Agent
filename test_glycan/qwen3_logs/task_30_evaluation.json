  "question": "Investigate the natural variants in the UniProt proteins P12345 and Q67890 associated with Alzheimer's disease 1 that are identified by UniProt and ClinVar sources, focusing on missense and stop gained mutations occurring at amino acid positions 10-60, where the wild-type amino acid is Alanine (A) and the alternative sequence is Valine (V) or deletion (-). Search only in human species (taxid 9606) and cross-reference with dbSNP and ClinVar databases using the rs121918508 ID.",
  "expected_trajectory": "search_natural_variants",
  "expected_answer": "Return a list of natural protein variants from the UniProt proteins P12345 and Q67890, filtered by the following criteria: source types UniProt and ClinVar, consequence types missense and stop gained, wild-type amino acid A, alternative sequence V or deletion (-), location 10-60, disease Alzheimer's disease 1, curated by dbSNP and ClinVar, with the rs121918508 ID in human species. Each variant should include details such as variant ID, location, consequence type, associated disease, and references.",

    "reasoning": "The agent failed to successfully complete the research task due to several critical issues in API usage and scientific accuracy. The agent attempted to use the `my_custom_mcp-search_natural_variants` API to find natural variants in the specified UniProt proteins related to Alzheimer's disease. However, the initial API call resulted in an error due to incorrect consequence type parameters, which the agent corrected in a subsequent attempt. Despite this correction, the final API call returned an empty result set, indicating that the agent did not retrieve any relevant data. The agent's reasoning suggested potential reasons for the lack of results, such as overly restrictive filters or incorrect dbSNP ID usage, but it did not take further steps to adjust the query parameters or verify the validity of the input data, such as the protein IDs or disease terms. The agent's final response did not provide any meaningful scientific insights or conclusions based on the task requirements.",
    "critical_issues": "1. The agent did not verify the validity of the protein IDs (P12345 and Q67890) or the disease term (\"Alzheimer's disease 1\") in the context of the databases used. 2. The agent did not attempt to adjust the query parameters further after receiving an empty result set, such as expanding the position range or removing the dbSNP filter. 3. The agent did not provide any meaningful scientific conclusions or insights based on the task requirements.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is questionable due to the lack of retrieved data and the absence of verification of the input parameters. The agent did not demonstrate a proper understanding of the relationship between the specified proteins, disease, and genetic variants.",

After correcting the parameters, the agent did not successfully retrieve any data. The agent's workflow lacked thorough verification of input data and did not explore alternative approaches to address the empty result set. The agent's reasoning suggested potential issues but did not take actionable steps to resolve them.",
