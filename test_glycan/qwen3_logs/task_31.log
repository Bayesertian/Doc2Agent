Task ID: 31
Original Question: The task is to analyze the glycan structure defined by the composition 'Hex:4|HexNAc:4|Fuc:1'. First, convert this composition into its WURCS format using 'convert_composition_to_wurcs'. Then, obtain the GlyTouCan ID from this WURCS format using 'obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs'. Finally, retrieve detailed information about the glycan using its GlyTouCan ID obtained from the second step with the 'glycan_detail' function. Specifically, we want to learn about the glycan's chemical properties and biological associations.
