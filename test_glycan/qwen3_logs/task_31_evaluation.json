  "question": "The task is to analyze the glycan structure defined by the composition 'Hex:4|HexNAc:4|Fuc:1'. First, convert this composition into its WURCS format using 'convert_composition_to_wurcs'. Then, obtain the GlyTouCan ID from this WURCS format using 'obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs'. Finally, retrieve detailed information about the glycan using its GlyTouCan ID obtained from the second step with the 'glycan_detail' function. Specifically, we want to learn about the glycan's chemical properties and biological associations.",
  "expected_trajectory": "convert_composition_to_wurcs -> obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs -> glycan_detail",
  "expected_answer": "The expected answer will include a detailed profile of the glycan which includes: chemical properties, biological associations, classifications, and cross-references. The output will amalgamate information on the specific structure provided in terms of its monosaccharide sequence and associated biological functions or connections to known databases.",

The task required the agent to convert a glycan composition into WURCS format, obtain a GlyTouCan ID, and then retrieve detailed information about the glycan. However, the agent encountered a \"BadRequestError\" due to exceeding the model's maximum context length, which prevented any further progress. As a result, the agent did not perform any of the required API calls, and no scientific data was retrieved or analyzed.
