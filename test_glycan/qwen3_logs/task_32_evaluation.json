Convert the provided IUPAC Extended format to WURCS format using the `convert_iupac_extended_to_wurcs` tool.\n2. Generate an image of the glycan structure using the `generate_glycan_image` tool with the output WURCS from step 1.\n3. Validate the generated WURCS format using the `validate_wurcs` tool to check for any errors or warnings. \n\nDocument each step with the outputs obtained from the tools.",
