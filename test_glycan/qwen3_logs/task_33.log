[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to use the 'partial_match_wurcs_rdf' tool with a specific WURCS string to find glycan structures. Then, for each GlyTouCan ID from that search, they want to get the WURCS and GlycoCT representations using 'obtain_wurcs_and_glycoct_from_glytoucan_id'. Finally, compare those sequences to find novel features.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the 'partial_match_wurcs_rdf' function is available. Looking at the tools provided, yes, it's there. The parameters require a 'wurcs' string. The user provided a WURCS=2.0... so I'll need to pass that as the 'wurcs' argument.\n\nOnce I call that function, it should return some GlyTouCan IDs. Then, for each of those IDs, I have to use the 'obtain_wurcs_and_glycoct_from_glytoucan_id' function, which takes a 'gtcid' parameter. So I'll need to loop through each ID and make separate calls.\n\nAfter gathering all the WURCS and GlycoCT sequences, the next step is to compare them to identify novel structural features. This part might require some analysis, maybe looking for differences in the monosaccharide composition, linkages, or branching patterns. Since the user wants to do this comparison, I might need to use the code interpreter tool to process and analyze the sequences.\n\nWait, but the tools listed don't include a direct comparison function. So the actual comparison would have to be done manually or via code. Since the assistant can use the code_interpreter, maybe I can generate the sequences and then write code to compare them.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Call partial_match_wurcs_rdf with the given WURCS.\n2. Extract GlyTouCan IDs from the response.\n3. For each ID, call obtain_wurcs_and_glycoct_from_glytoucan_id.\n4. Collect all WURCS and GlycoCT sequences.\n5. Use code to compare these sequences and find differences.\n\nBut since the assistant can only make one tool call at a time, I'll need to proceed step by step. First, call the partial_match function. Then, for each resulting GTID, call the obtain function. Then, use the code interpreter to compare.\n\nHowever, the user might not have provided the actual implementation details of these functions, so maybe the response from partial_match is simulated.
