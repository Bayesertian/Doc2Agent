For each GlyTouCan ID obtained, use 'obtain_wurcs_and_glycoct_from_glytoucan_id' to get the corresponding WURCS and GlycoCT sequence representations.

However, the agent's performance was incomplete and flawed in several key areas: 1. **API Usage Appropriateness**: The agent correctly used the 'partial_match_wurcs_rdf' tool to obtain GlyTouCan IDs and then used 'obtain_wurcs_and_glycoct_from_glytoucan_id' to retrieve sequences. However, the agent failed to handle the task's completion due to a context length error, which indicates a lack of proper management of the conversation context. 2. **Scientific Accuracy**: The agent provided some analysis of the glycan structures, noting differences in anomeric configurations and branching patterns. However, the analysis was not comprehensive, and the agent did not fully explore the implications of these structural differences in a biological context. The agent also failed to provide a GlycoCT sequence for G44161QY, which was a critical part of the task. 3. **Completeness**: The agent did not complete the task as it failed to provide a final answer within the <FINISH></FINISH> tags due to a context length error. The analysis was incomplete, and the agent did not synthesize the results into a coherent conclusion. 4. **Data Integration**: While the agent attempted to integrate data from multiple API calls, the final synthesis of results was lacking. The agent did not effectively compare the sequences to identify novel structural features comprehensively. 5. **Research Workflow**: The agent followed a logical workflow initially but failed to manage the conversation context effectively, leading to an error that prevented task completion. The agent did not handle the error gracefully or attempt to reduce the message length to continue the analysis.",
