Original Question: Considering the glycan structure represented in WURCS format 'WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1', generate a visual image of the glycan and then validate the WURCS notation for accuracy. The research task is aligned towards creating reliable visual datasets of glycan structures that are validated as per scientific standards. Use 'generate_glycan_image' to create an image in 'png' format with 'html' response type and use 'validate_wurcs' to ensure the WURCS notation is correctly formatted and free of errors.

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to generate a visual image of a glycan structure from a given WURCS notation and validate the WURCS for accuracy. \n\nFirst, I need to use the 'generate_glycan_image' function. The parameters required are format, type, wurcs, and verify. The user specified 'png' format and 'html' type, and provided the WURCS string. The verify parameter defaults to true, which is good because it will check the WURCS validity during image generation.\n\nNext, after generating the image, I should call 'validate_wurcs' with the same WURCS string to ensure there are no errors. Even though the generate function might validate it, a separate validation ensures thoroughness.\n\nI should check if the WURCS is correctly formatted. The WURCS version is 2.0, which is standard. The structure has three monosaccharides with their respective annotations. Each monosaccharide part seems to follow the WURCS syntax, with proper linkage and stereochemistry. However, I need to make sure there are no typos or incorrect symbols. For example, the first monosaccharide has [a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O], which includes a nitrogen and a carbonyl group. The linkages between the monosaccharides are specified as 1-1-2-3-3, which should be checked for correct numbering.\n\nAssuming the WURCS is valid, the image should be generated without issues. If there's an error in the WURCS, the validation step will catch it, and the image might not be generated correctly. The user's goal is to create a reliable dataset, so validation is crucial here.\n\nI'll proceed by first calling generate_glycan_image with the provided parameters. Then, use validate_wurcs to check the WURCS. If both steps are successful, the user gets a validated image and confirms the WURCS accuracy. If there's an error in validation, the image might not be reliable, and the user would need to adjust the WURCS.\n"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-generate_glycan_image', 'arguments': '{"format": "png", "type": "html", "wurcs": "WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1", "verify": true}'}}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-validate_wurcs', 'arguments': '{"wurcs": "WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1"}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '{\n  "status_code": 200,\n  "url": "https://api.glycosmos.org/wurcs2image/1.25.0",\n  "content_type": "text",\n  "data": "<img src=\\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAO4AAACGCAIAAABVKyFCAAAGtUlEQVR4Xu3dP27cRhSAcQJbqHBhu1JgCHACuIlVaHdhQ63LCNjASaFzCNojOFeIO6cxghS6gtPoNjqEwM3QE9Gj4R+RnPeo2efvByJQqPXsLPlZIFbccbEDTCjiHcB+ImUYQcowgpRhBCnDCFKGEaQMI0gZRpAyjCBlGEHKMIKUYQQpwwhShhGkDCNIGUaQMowgZRhByjCClGEEKcMIUoYRpAwjSBlGkDKMIGUYQcowgpRhBCnDiFlTLsvy+vp6u92+ffu2+Oro6Mh97fa4/e678R8ABpsv5S9fvhQ/PitePi3Ofy7+eFf8+Uvxz+/Vf93Xbs/Lp6vVyj0m/mPAMHOkfHt7e3FxURw+KS5Pq3y7Nvfdwyfuke7x8RDAQ9RTdl0Wqx+K5WHx169xu83NPWZ5uNlsqBljqadc/Tx2Hf/9W1xt1+YeuTx0fyoeCOilm3J1feyuKz5t4l77t0+bV69ecd2MURRTLsuy+OnZA9fHXdvl6Xq95j0NDKeY8vX1dfV+RTPTYdvJyYkbIR4U6KCY8na7Lc5fNxsdup2/diPEgwIdFFN+8+ZN8eFdHOjw7cM7N0I8KNBBMeXqt3kfz+JAh28fz168eBEPCnRQTvnz+zjQ4dvn9wcHB/GgQAfFlN3PVH4qYzaKKXOtjDkppsw7GJiTYsqJ7ysfHx/zvjKGU0y5LMv1ej35t32LxeLy8vLm5iYeF2ijmPIu7R6Mq6srl/Lz588JGkPoprybdGfc2dlZfWeci5igMYR6yre3t5vNZvj9yq7j5v3KBI0Hqae8u/sUibtmeOC6+fLUPabnUyQEjR5zpOy56+bVarVcLls/2+f2D/xsH0Gj1Xwp7+5/4vro6CjlE9cEjcisKYsjaNT2O2WPoLHLPGW/7Ivn/zd+RICgv3N9cTy6sN3+jmuTg85n5aTg7+908aBC4qeZJB5UiNa4IsKXPeoQjA06q5WTqrO9/TdpG3OsRsl6bvGOnExO2RsSdIYrJ2WdS85zi3fkpH7Z1RGcegh6gs5z5aSsc8l5bvGOzPiI/euvv5igNegJ94fMsHJS1rnkPLd4x/67i7/lpYVBX11dTb5rT/W6Oetccp5bvGPPhUeq66j5oLNdOSnrXHKeW7xjnw0/TImfcFFdOSnrXITmVo1zJ36OqcQGykF0mOJvB3L+3GE19WYBo7be155Cam71DB88U8PJjJKJ8Lj0H6OcPw1ezbtZwKit+4UnkprbwNM0iswomYgOSs8xqo5frmt0SOWiQWpuYcr3niCB2EA5GJdy2spJ1Qh6mgWM2lQ1n27UFqTsx4vPzVRiA2WiPjT9hynnlZOkctEgNbdwhlKzlRklH75gL/5egGvlaaTmFs5QarYyo+ydTN7BaD2LUrkkah1Eam6kLCaH95WrLNrOolQuKbTnVg/e9UQTyIyyX/xv+xaLheBv+/wpGX5iojMaqoZoFjBquz9shnMbNZ+BJMfKn949GPVZGXKGwgff/87/O+PTP3ZrpPxt5LZnDM0zt9bBE8mPmCepO+PClZNCGeYSDvht5LZnDM0zt9bBE8mPmJvWiD2RlZO8/gJCvqdI/IBmAaO2xoDRF13uzelO/IDm043aHprDZFrj5qAn4prUykn+DDXPfb/WB4vnkvPcBGmN+7iGRBxKXzkpPEPDz1brI8VzyXlugrTGfSxjI64lrpw0IZcqi6+69qeIBmz9ukfrOOH+FNGYUrTGnV9PxHMcx/G5zCbnuQmy8MJ6It41Tp7SuayHVf0LM03OcxO03y+sP+JWSufSV6I0eKKc5yZo1pcnuALQhIg9pTOqNKyInOcmaL4XKbUC0LSItX8y6Y2cLue5CZrjRUqtADQt4pBqzXhc6udVZAWg9IhrpGyV+nmdcJ9DuAJQesRRu6Rsle55zeTf7asvlOnYMMVTW5Zl...

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let me go through the user's request again to make sure I didn't miss anything. They wanted to generate a glycan image from a WURCS string and validate it. I called both functions, generate_glycan_image and validate_wurcs. The responses came back successfully. The validation had no errors, which is good. The image was generated as a base64 string.\n\nWait, the user mentioned creating a reliable visual dataset. So maybe they need the image in a usable format. The base64 data is there, but perhaps I should explain how to use it. Also, since the validation passed, the structure is correct. I should highlight that the WURCS is valid, so the image accurately represents the glycan. \n\nI should check if there's any additional information needed. The user didn't ask for anything else, so summarizing the results should be enough. Make sure to mention both the validation success and the image availability. Offer further help in case they need more adjustments. That should cover it.\n"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\n\n<FINISH>\nThe glycan structure has been successfully processed as follows:\n\n**1. Validation Status**  \n✅ **WURCS Validation Passed**  \n- No errors, warnings, or unverifiable elements detected in the WURCS notation.  \n- The structure adheres to WURCS 2.0 standards, ensuring scientific accuracy.\n\n**2. Visual Representation**  \n🖼️ **Image Generated**  \n- A PNG image of the glycan is available in base64 format.  \n- **To use the image**:  \n  1. Decode the base64 string (e.g., using `base64 --decode` or online tools).  \n  2. Save the output as a `.png` file for visualization or dataset inclusion.\n\n**3.
