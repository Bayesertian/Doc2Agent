  "question": "Considering the glycan structure represented in WURCS format 'WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1', generate a visual image of the glycan and then validate the WURCS notation for accuracy. The research task is aligned towards creating reliable visual datasets of glycan structures that are validated as per scientific standards. Use 'generate_glycan_image' to create an image in 'png' format with 'html' response type and use 'validate_wurcs' to ensure the WURCS notation is correctly formatted and free of errors.",
  "expected_trajectory": "generate_glycan_image -> validate_wurcs",
  "expected_answer": "1. Glycan structure image in 'png' format returned by 'generate_glycan_image'. 2. Validation results from 'validate_wurcs', indicating if there are any errors or warnings in the WURCS notation.",

    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by using the appropriate sequence of glycan APIs to address the research question. The agent first called the `generate_glycan_image` function to create a visual representation of the glycan structure in PNG format, as requested. This was followed by the `validate_wurcs` function to ensure the WURCS notation was correctly formatted and free of errors. The agent's approach aligns with the expected trajectory, and both API calls returned successful results. The validation confirmed that the WURCS notation was free of errors, warnings, or unverifiable issues, indicating scientific accuracy. The agent also provided clear instructions on how to decode and use the base64-encoded image, ensuring completeness and usability of the results. The agent's workflow was logical and consistent with glycomics best practices, as it started with the appropriate tool discovery, handled the API responses correctly, and drew appropriate conclusions based on the results.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The results are scientifically valid. The WURCS notation was correctly interpreted and validated, ensuring the glycan structure adheres to WURCS 2.0 standards. The agent's explanation of the validation process and the image generation was accurate and meaningful for glycomics research.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the appropriate tools and followed a logical workflow. The sequence of API calls was correct, and the agent effectively integrated the results from both the image generation and validation processes. The agent's reasoning and explanation demonstrated a clear understanding of the task requirements and the scientific context.",
