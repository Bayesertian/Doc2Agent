Round 1 - ASSISTANT

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let\'s tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to convert a GWS formatted glycan into WURCS format using the GlycoSMOS API and then get the GlyTouCan ID for that WURCS using another API. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions are available for these tasks. Looking at the provided tools, there\'s a function called my_custom_mcp-convert_gws_format_to_wurcs_format which takes a GWS string and converts it to WURCS. The parameters require the GWS input. So I\'ll start by calling that function with the given GWS string.\n\nOnce I get the WURCS from the first step, the next task is to obtain the GlyTouCan ID. There\'s another function, my_custom_mcp-obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs, which takes a WURCS string as input. So I\'ll use the output from the first function as the input for the second one.\n\nI should make sure that the GWS string is correctly formatted. The user provided \'freeEnd--?b1D-GlcNAc,p--3b1D-Gal,p--4b1D-Glc,p--6b1D-GlcNAc,p$MONO,Und,0,0,freeEnd\'. I need to pass this exactly as is to the convert_gws_format_to_wurcs_format function. The parameters for that function expect a "gws" key, so I\'ll structure the arguments accordingly.\n\nAfter converting to WURCS, the obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs function will need the WURCS string. The parameters here require a "wurcs" key. Assuming the first function returns the WURCS correctly, I can then call the second function with that result.\n\nI should also check if there are any potential errors, like invalid GWS format or issues with the API responses, but since the functions are supposed to handle the API calls, I\'ll proceed under the assumption that they work as described. Let\'s start with the first function call.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-convert_gws_format_to_wurcs_format', 'arguments': '{"gws": "freeEnd--?b1D-GlcNAc,p--3b1D-Gal,p--4b1D-Glc,p--6b1D-GlcNAc,p$MONO,Und,0,0,freeEnd"}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '[\n  {\n    "message": "Accession not found.",\n    "wurcs": "WURCS=2.0/3,4,3/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a2112h-1b_1-5][a2122h-1b_1-5]/1-2-3-1/a3-b1_b4-c1_c6-d1",\n    "WURCS": "WURCS=2.0/3,4,3/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a2112h-1b_1-5][a2122h-1b_1-5]/1-2-3-1/a3-b1_b4-c1_c6-d1",\n    "input": "freeEnd--?b1D-GlcNAc,p--3b1D-Gal,p--4b1D-Glc,p--6b1D-GlcNAc,p$MONO,Und,0,0,freeEnd",\n    "GlycoCT": "RES\\n1b:b-dglc-HEX-1:5\\n2s:n-acetyl\\n3b:b-dgal-HEX-1:5\\n4b:b-dglc-HEX-1:5\\n5b:b-dglc-HEX-1:5\\n6s:n-acetyl\\nLIN\\n1:1d(2+1)2n\\n2:1o(3+1)3d\\n3:3o(4+1)4d\\n4:4o(6+1)5d\\n5:5d(2+1)6n"\n  }\n]', 'name': 'my_custom_mcp-convert_gws_format_to_wurcs_format'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to handle this. The user wants to convert a GWS formatted glycan into WURCS using the GlycoSMOS API and then get the GlyTouCan ID for that WURCS.\n\nFirst, I called the function my_custom_mcp-convert_gws_format_to_wurcs_format with the provided GWS string. The response from the tool gave me a WURCS string. Now, I need to use that WURCS to obtain the GlyTouCan ID. \n\nLooking at the available functions, there\'s my_custom_mcp-obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs which takes a WURCS as input.

I should pass this into the obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs function. \n\nI need to make sure that the WURCS is correctly formatted and that there are no errors. The tool response also mentioned an "Accession not found." message, but the WURCS was generated. Maybe that\'s a warning, but the conversion still proceeded. \n\nSo the next function call should be my_custom_mcp-obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs with the WURCS string from the previous step. Then, the user will get the GlyTouCan ID they need.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs', 'arguments': '{"wurcs": "WURCS=2.0/3,4,3/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a2112h-1b_1-5][a2122h-1b_1-5]/1-2-3-1/a3-b1_b4-c1_c6-d1"}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '[\n  {\n    "message": "Accession not found."\n  }\n]', 'name': 'my_custom_mcp-obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let\'s see. The user wanted to convert a GWS formatted glycan to WURCS and then get the GlyTouCan ID. First, I called the convert_gws_format_to_wurcs_format function with the provided GWS string. The response gave a WURCS string, which I then used in the obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs function. However, the second tool returned "Accession not found." \n\nHmm, why might that happen? Maybe the WURCS generated isn\'t valid or doesn\'t exist in the GlyTouCan database. Let me check the WURCS format. The tool\'s response included both "wurcs" and "WURCS" keys, with the latter in uppercase. Could the case sensitivity matter for the API? Some APIs are strict about case. The function might expect the WURCS in a specific format, maybe uppercase.\n\nWait, the obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs function\'s parameters have a "wurcs" field, which is case-sensitive. The response from the first tool provided "WURCS=2.0..." with uppercase. Maybe the second function expects lowercase "wurcs="? Let me check the function definitions. The first function\'s response has "WURCS" in uppercase, but the second function\'s parameter is "wurcs". \n\nSo, when passing the WURCS string to the second function, perhaps the case of the "WURCS" keyword matters. The API might be expecting it in a specific case, maybe lowercase. Let me adjust the WURCS string to start with "wurcs=2.0..." instead of "WURCS=2.0...". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the WURCS string itself is incorrect. The first tool\'s response included some parts like [a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O], but perhaps there\'s an error in the WURCS structure. However, the user\'s initial GWS seems plausible. Another possibility is that the GlyTouCan database doesn\'t have an entry for this specific glycan structure. \n\nBut given that the first step worked (converted to WURCS), the issue is likely with the second step. Let me try modifying the WURCS string\'s case and resend it. If that doesn\'t work, maybe there\'s no GlyTouCan ID for this structure. Alternatively, maybe the API requires additional parameters or a different format. Since the user\'s second function call returned "Accession not found," the problem is either the WURCS format or the absence of the glycan in the database.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "\n\nThe conversion from GWS to WURCS was successful, but no GlyTouCan ID was found for the generated WURCS string. This could occur if the specific glycan structure does not exist in the GlyTouCan database.

The absence of a GlyTouCan ID suggests this glycan may not be registered in public databases."}]

But when trying to get the GlyTouCan ID, it says "Accession not found."\n\nHmm, maybe the WURCS format is correct but the GlyTouCan database doesn\'t have an entry for this specific structure. GlyTouCan might not cover all possible glycans, especially if it\'s a complex or less common one. Alternatively, there could be an issue with how the WURCS is formatted for the second API call. Let me check the parameters again. The first tool\'s response has "WURCS=..." with uppercase, but the second function\'s parameter is "wurcs" (lowercase). Could that matter? Some APIs are case-sensitive, so maybe the second function expects the WURCS string in lowercase. Let me try adjusting the case. If that doesn\'t work, then it\'s likely the structure isn\'t in the database. Also, the user might need to check for any possible errors in the original GWS input, but the conversion seems valid.
