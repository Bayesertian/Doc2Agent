[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to determine the molecular mass of the glycan with the composition 'Hex(3)HexNAc(2)'. The instructions say to first convert this composition to WURCS format using the convert_composition_text_to_wurcs_format tool, and then calculate the mass from the WURCS using calculate_mass_from_wurcs.\n\nFirst, I need to check if I have the right tools. Looking at the provided functions, there's my_custom_mcp-convert_composition_text_to_wurcs_format which takes a text parameter. The composition here is 'Hex(3)HexNAc(2)', so I should call that function with that text. The output should be the WURCS string.\n\nOnce I have the WURCS, the next step is to use my_custom_mcp-calculate_mass_from_wurcs, which requires the WURCS as input. That should give the molecular mass.\n\nWait, I should make sure that the functions are correctly named and parameters are properly formatted. Let me double-check the function signatures. The convert_composition_text_to_wurcs_format has a parameter 'text' which is the composition. The calculate_mass_from_wurcs needs 'wurcs' as the parameter. So the first tool call should be with text='Hex(3)HexNAc(2)', then take the resulting WURCS and pass it to the second tool.\n\nI should also consider possible errors. For example, if the composition is invalid, the conversion might fail. But the user is asking to validate the molecular weight, so assuming the composition is correct. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst tool call: convert_composition_text_to_wurcs_format with text='Hex(3)HexNAc(2)'.\n\nThen, take the output WURCS and pass it to calculate_mass_from_wurcs. The result should be the mass.

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let's see. The user asked for the molecular mass of Hex(3)HexNAc(2). I first converted the composition to WURCS using the convert_composition_text_to_wurcs_format tool. The response gave a WURCS string and an ID. Then, I used calculate_mass_from_wurcs with that WURCS, and the result was 910.32778 g/mol.\n\nWait, the WURCS string seems a bit complex. Let me check if that's correct. The composition is 3 Hex and 2 HexNAc. Hex is glucose (C6H10O5), HexNAc is N-acetylglucosamine (C8H13NO5). Calculating the molecular weight manually: \n\nHex (C6H10O5) has a molar mass of about 162.14 g/mol. Three Hex would be 3*162.14 = 486.42 g/mol.\n\nHexNAc (C8H13NO5) has a molar mass of around 221.18 g/mol. Two HexNAc would be 2*221.18 = 442.36 g/mol.\n\nAdding them together: 486.42 + 442.36 = 928.78 g/mol. But the tool gave 910.33. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Maybe the WURCS representation includes some linkage or other structural features that affect the mass. Or perhaps the tool accounts for different isotopes or specific forms. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in manual calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. Hex (glucose) is C6H12O6 (180.16 g/mol), but when polymerized, each Hex in a glycan loses a water molecule (H2O, 18.02 g/mol). So for a trisaccharide with three Hex, maybe the mass is adjusted. But Hex(3)HexNAc(2) is a composition, not a specific structure. The tool's result might be more accurate because it considers the exact structure defined by the WURCS. The user's requirement was to use the tools provided, so the answer from the tool should be the correct one. Therefore, the final answer is 910.33 g/mol.\n"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "\n\nThe molecular mass of the glycan with the composition **Hex(3)HexNAc(2)** was determined through the following steps:\n\n1. **Convert Composition to WURCS**:  \n   The glycan composition `Hex(3)HexNAc(2)` was converted to WURCS format using the `convert_composition_text_to_wurcs_format` tool, resulting in the WURCS string:  \n   `WURCS=2.0/2,5,4/[axxxxh-1x_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][axxxxh-1x_1-5]/1-1-2-2-2/a?|b?|c?|d?|e?}-{a?|b?|c?|d?|e?_a?|b?|c?|d?|e?}-{a?|b?|c?|d?|e?_a?|b?|c?|d?|e?}-{a?|b?|c?|d?|e?_a?|b?|c?|d?|e?}-{a?|b?|c?|d?|e?`.\n\n2. **Calculate Molecular Mass**:  \n   Using the `calculate_mass_from_wurcs` tool with the derived WURCS, the molecular mass was computed as **910.33 g/mol**.\n\nThis value reflects the precise molecular weight based on the structural representation of the glycan in WURCS format.
