Task ID: 39
Original Question: In this research task, we aim to validate a glycan structure in WURCS format and subsequently obtain its corresponding GlyTouCan ID. The specific glycan to be tested is given in WURCS format as `WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1`. 

The task involves:
1. Validating the provided WURCS string using the `validate_wurcs` function to ensure that it is correctly formatted and free of errors or warnings.
2. Upon successful validation (i.e., no critical errors), using the `obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs` function to retrieve the GlyTouCan ID for the validated structure.

Your task is to execute these steps sequentially and report any validation results as well as the final GlyTouCan ID if available.

The user wants to validate a WURCS-formatted glycan structure and then get its GlyTouCan ID. First, I need to use the validate_wurcs function to check if the WURCS string is correct.
