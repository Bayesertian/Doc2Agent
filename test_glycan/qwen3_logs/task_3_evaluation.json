  "question": "What are the MolecularFormula, MolecularWeight, and InChIKey properties of the compounds with PubChem IDs 2244, 5957, and 7629? This information is crucial for understanding the structural and chemical characteristics of these compounds, which are important in glycan-related biochemical pathways.",
  "expected_trajectory": "compound_property_tables",
  "expected_answer": "The CSV data should include the following details for each compound: MolecularFormula, which provides the elemental composition; MolecularWeight, which gives the compound's mass in Daltons; and InChIKey, a unique identifier for chemical substances. Each compound should be represented in a separate line with these property values.",

    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by retrieving the MolecularFormula, MolecularWeight, and InChIKey properties for the compounds with PubChem IDs 2244, 5957, and 7629. The agent used the appropriate API, `compound_property_tables`, to obtain the necessary data in CSV format, which aligns with the expected trajectory. The agent correctly parsed the CSV data and presented it in a clear table format, including additional notes on the relevance of each compound. The agent's reasoning and final output were scientifically accurate and meaningful for glycomics research, as the compounds' properties were correctly identified and contextualized.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific validity of the results is high. The agent accurately identified the compounds and their properties, providing correct molecular formulas, weights, and InChIKeys. The additional context about each compound's role in biochemical pathways was appropriate and informative.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the correct API to retrieve the necessary data and followed a logical workflow. The agent demonstrated a good understanding of the API's parameters and effectively parsed and presented the data. The workflow was consistent with glycomics best practices, and the agent handled the task efficiently without errors.",
