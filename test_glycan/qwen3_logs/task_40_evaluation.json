  "question": "Investigate the role of Siglecs (Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectins) in human diseases by identifying curated Siglecs and retrieving detailed protein information, including disease associations.\n\n1. Use `get_human_lectome` to retrieve UniProt IDs for Siglecs with curated lectin status: call `get_human_lectome(getcolumns=\"RefSeqID,UniProt_ID\", wherecolumn=\"common_protein_name\", isvalue=\"%SIGLEC%\", limit=1000)`.\n2. For each UniProt ID obtained, use `protein_detail` to get detailed information about the protein: call `protein_detail(uniprot_canonical_ac='<UniProt_ID>')` using the UniProt_ID from step 1.",
  "expected_trajectory": "get_human_lectome -> protein_detail",
  "expected_answer": "The expected answer should include a list of Siglecs, each with its UniProt ID and corresponding detailed information such as disease associations, glycosylation data, and structural details retrieved from GlyGen.",

    "reasoning": "The agent attempted to address the research question by using the `get_human_lectome` API to retrieve UniProt IDs for Siglecs, which was appropriate and aligned with the expected trajectory. However, the subsequent `protein_detail` API calls failed due to SSL certificate errors, preventing the agent from retrieving detailed protein information, including disease associations. The agent did not successfully complete the task as it could not provide the expected detailed information for each Siglec, such as disease associations, glycosylation data, and structural details. The agent did attempt to provide alternative solutions by suggesting manual data retrieval from UniProt and GlyGen, which shows an understanding of the research workflow. However, the final answer lacked the comprehensive data integration and synthesis expected from the task, as it relied on general knowledge rather than specific data retrieved from the APIs.",
    "critical_issues": "The major problem was the failure to retrieve detailed protein information due to SSL certificate errors, which the agent did not resolve effectively. The agent's reliance on manual data retrieval and general knowledge did not fully address the research question.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is limited due to the lack of specific data retrieved from the APIs. The agent's general descriptions of Siglecs and their disease associations are broadly correct but lack the depth and specificity that would be expected from a detailed API query.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent initially used the appropriate API (`get_human_lectome`) to retrieve UniProt IDs, but the failure to handle SSL errors in the `protein_detail` API calls hindered the completion of the task. The agent's suggestion to bypass SSL verification is not a recommended practice for secure data retrieval. The agent did not fully utilize the available tools to achieve the research objective.",
