  "question": "Investigate potential lectin-glycan interactions from bacterial lectins and obtain proteomics data for these lectins by performing the following sequence of tasks. First, retrieve lectin data from the UniLectin database for bacterial proteins. Use the 'get_predicted_lectins' function with the parameters: `getcolumns=\"fold,domain,uniprot,superkingdom\"`, `wherecolumn=\"superkingdom\"`, `isvalue=\"Bacteria%\"`, and `limit=10`. From the returned results, extract the UniProt accessions. Next, use these accessions to get proteomics peptides by calling the 'get_proteomics_peptides_by_accession' function, passing each UniProt accession one at a time as the `accession` parameter. This will allow us to connect predicted bacterial lectins to their peptide features at the proteomics level, potentially revealing new insights into lectin functions.",
  "expected_trajectory": "get_predicted_lectins -> get_proteomics_peptides_by_accession",
  "expected_answer": "The expected output will include bacterial lectin data entries with their corresponding proteomics peptides information. Each entry will provide lectin structural domains, folds, and the superkingdom data from `get_predicted_lectins` linked to peptide sequences and features obtained from `get_proteomics_peptides_by_accession` for each UniProt accession.",

    "reasoning": "The agent did not successfully complete the research task. The task required retrieving bacterial lectin data from the UniLectin database and obtaining proteomics data for these lectins using UniProt accessions. The agent correctly initiated the process by calling the `get_predicted_lectins` function with the specified parameters, which returned a list of predicted lectins. However, the agent encountered issues when attempting to retrieve proteomics data using the `get_proteomics_peptides_by_accession` function, as both UniProt accessions returned 404 errors, indicating they were either obsolete or not found in the proteomics database. The agent's response to these errors was to suggest verifying the accessions on UniProt and refining the query, but it did not take further steps to resolve the issue or provide alternative solutions to obtain the required proteomics data. The agent's final response did not include any valid proteomics data, which was a key part of the research question.",
