Task ID: 42
Original Question: A glycomics research team is working on modeling the structure of a complex glycan. The project UUID for this specific task is 'a997768f-6097-4aa6-9789-c756252358df'. Verify the status of this glycan modeling project using the project UUID, and if the status indicates that the modeling is complete, generate a glycan image using the WURCS notation 'WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1'. Specify 'png' format for image generation with an 'html' response type.

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to check the status of a glycan modeling project using a specific UUID and then generate an image if the status is complete.\n\nFirst, I need to use the 'poll_project_status' function with the given UUID 'a997768f-6097-4aa6-9789-c756252358df'. This function should return the current status of the project. \n\nAssuming the status comes back as complete, the next step is to generate the glycan image using the provided WURCS notation. The 'generate_glycan_image' function is the right tool here. The parameters required are the WURCS string, format as 'png', and response type as 'html'. \n\nI need to make sure the WURCS string is correctly formatted and that all parameters are passed properly. Let me check the function signatures again to confirm the required parameters. The 'generate_glycan_image' function has optional parameters, but the user specified 'png' and 'html', so I'll include those. \n\nI should structure the tool calls in order: first the status check, then the image generation if needed. Each tool call should be in its own XML tags as specified.\n"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'function_call': {'name': 'my_custom_mcp-poll_project_status', 'arguments': '{"pUUID": "a997768f-6097-4aa6-9789-c756252358df"}'}}, {'role': 'function', 'content': '{\n  "status": "submitted",\n  "absolute_conformer_path": "",\n  "default_conformer_id": "structure"\n}', 'name': 'my_custom_mcp-poll_project_status'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let\'s see. The user asked to check the status of a glycan modeling project with the UUID \'a997768f-6097-4aa6-9789-c756252358df\'. I called the \'poll_project_status\' function, which returned that the status is "submitted" and the default conformer ID is "structure". \n\nNow, the next step is to determine if the modeling is complete. The response doesn\'t explicitly say "complete", so I need to check what "submitted" means. Maybe "submitted" means the job is still processing. If that\'s the case, the user might need to wait or check again later.\n\nBut the user\'s instruction says if the status indicates completion, then generate the image. Since the status here is "submitted", it\'s probably not complete yet. However, there\'s an \'absolute_conformer_path\' empty, which might mean the results aren\'t available yet. \n\nIn this case, the appropriate response would be to inform the user that the project is still in the submitted state and hasn\'t completed modeling. Therefore, generating the image isn\'t possible yet. They might need to check back later or look into the project settings for more details.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\n\nThe glycan modeling project with UUID `a997768f-6097-4aa6-9789-c756252358df` currently has a status of **"submitted"**, and the `absolute_conformer_path` is empty. This suggests the modeling process has not yet completed. \n\nNo image generation was performed, as the project status does not indicate completion. You may need to wait for the modeling to finish or verify the project configuration.'}]

[{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'reasoning_content': '\nOkay, let me go through the user\'s problem again. They want to check the status of a glycan modeling project using a specific UUID and then generate an image if the status is complete.\n\nFirst, I called the \'poll_project_status\' function with the provided UUID. The response came back showing the status as "submitted" and the absolute_conformer_path as empty. That probably means the job is still in progress and hasn\'t finished yet. \n\nSince the status isn\'t "complete" or any other indicator that the modeling is done, the next step is to inform the user that the project isn\'t ready. The image generation can\'t happen until the modeling is done. The user might need to wait or check again later. \n\nI should make sure there\'s no other function to check the status differently, but based on the tools available, \'poll_project_status\' is the right one. The response from that function clearly shows the project isn\'t complete. So the final answer should state that the project is still submitted and the image can\'t be generated yet.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\n\n<FINISH>\nThe glycan modeling project with UUID `a997768f-6097-4aa6-9789-c756252358df` is currently in the **"submitted"** state, as confirmed by the `poll_project_status` tool. The empty `absolute_conformer_path` indicates that the modeling process has not yet completed, and no output files are available. \n\nSince the project status does not reflect completion, the glycan image generation step using the provided WURCS notation cannot proceed at this time. You may need to monitor the project status periodically or consult the system documentation for expected processing times. \n\nNo further tool calls were executed.\n</FINISH>'}]
