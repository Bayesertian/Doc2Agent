  "question": "A glycomics research team is working on modeling the structure of a complex glycan. The project UUID for this specific task is 'a997768f-6097-4aa6-9789-c756252358df'. Verify the status of this glycan modeling project using the project UUID, and if the status indicates that the modeling is complete, generate a glycan image using the WURCS notation 'WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1'. Specify 'png' format for image generation with an 'html' response type.",

  "expected_answer": "1. The current status of the glycan project (e.g., 'All complete', 'minimizing', etc.). \n2. If the status is 'All complete', the task should return a PNG image of the glycan structure based on the provided WURCS notation.",

    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by following a logical and scientifically valid approach. The agent correctly used the `poll_project_status` API to check the status of the glycan modeling project using the provided UUID. The response indicated that the project status was \"submitted,\" which the agent accurately interpreted as the modeling process not being complete. Consequently, the agent correctly determined that it was not appropriate to proceed with generating the glycan image, as the modeling was not finished. The agent's reasoning and decision-making process were consistent with glycomics research practices, and the agent provided a clear explanation to the user about the current status and the inability to generate the image at this time.",

    "scientific_accuracy": "The agent demonstrated a correct understanding of the glycan modeling process and the implications of the project status. The interpretation of the \"submitted\" status as an indication that the modeling was not complete was scientifically accurate. The agent also correctly refrained from generating the glycan image, as the necessary data was not yet available.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the appropriate API (`poll_project_status`) to check the project status, which was the correct first step in the expected workflow. The agent's decision not to proceed with the `generate_glycan_image` API was appropriate given the incomplete status of the project. The agent followed a logical research workflow, starting with the status check and making decisions based on the results obtained.",
