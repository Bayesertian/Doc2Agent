Task ID: 43
Original Question: Can we identify genetic variants in the human protein SERPINA1 that might affect its glycosylation pattern and function, as well as correlate these with known diseases? First, retrieve protein details for SERPINA1 (UniProt accession code P01009), then use this information to search for natural variants associated with glycosylation-related sites within the protein sequence using UniProt's variant database.
