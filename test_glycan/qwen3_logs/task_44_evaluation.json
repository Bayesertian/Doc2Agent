  "question": "How can we validate the glycan structure and readiness for glycosylation of the compound represented by the WURCS string 'WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1', and represent it visually? \n\n1. Use the `validate_wurcs` tool with the given WURCS string to verify and standardized format.\n2. Use `generate_glycan_image` to produce a visual representation of the glycan in PNG format from the validated WURCS string.\n3. Use `validate_composition_for_glycosylation` to confirm if the validated WURCS composition is suitable for glycosylation.",

  "expected_answer": "1. Validation result of the WURCS string including any errors, warnings, or warnings from `validate_wurcs`.\n2. A PNG image of the glycan structure from `generate_glycan_image`.\n3. Validation result indicating whether the glycan is ready for glycosylation from `validate_composition_for_glycosylation`.",

The task required the agent to validate a WURCS string, generate a visual representation of the glycan, and confirm its readiness for glycosylation. However, the agent encountered an error during the first step, which prevented it from proceeding with the subsequent steps. The error message \"peer closed connection without sending complete message body (incomplete chunked read)\" indicates a failure in the API call, which the agent did not handle or recover from. As a result, the agent did not provide any of the expected outputs, such as the validation result, the PNG image, or the glycosylation readiness assessment.",
