  "question": "Can we identify potential ligand interactions for epitopes related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein using glycan-related data? This will involve first searching for the epitopes related to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the UniProt database using the 'search_epitope' tool and then using the 'get_ligands' tool to find glycan structures that could potentially interact with these epitopes based on ligand data in the UniLectin database.\n\nStep 1: Utilize the `search_epitope` function to retrieve data on epitopes associated with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Set the parameter `accession='P0DTC2'` to specifically search for epitopes related to the spike protein.\n\nStep 2: From the epitopes retrieved in Step 1, extract sequences or specific identifiers (e.g., IEDB IDs) and use the `get_ligands` function to search for corresponding ligands in the UniLectin database. Use `wherecolumn='ligand_id'` with `isvalue='%extracted_epitope_identifier%'` from the previous step.\n\nParameters:\n1. `search_epitope`: `accession='P0DTC2'`\n2. `get_ligands`: Initially, use `isvalue='%extracted_epitope_identifier%'`, where extracted_epitope_identifier represents the potential binding identifier of epitopes obtained from the first tool.",
  "expected_trajectory": "search_epitope -> get_ligands",
  "expected_answer": "The expected outcome is a list of ligands with their IDs and IUPAC names that have potential interactions with epitopes found on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This would provide insights into potential glycan-based interactions and could inform further research into vaccine design or antiviral strategies.",
