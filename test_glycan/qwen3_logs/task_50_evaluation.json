  "question": "How do different lectins from specific species interact with proteins that have known glycosylation sites, and what are these sites? First, retrieve lectins from the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the UniLectin3D database, then fetch detailed protein information including glycosylation sites for these lectins using their UniProt IDs. Specifically, use the get_lectins tool with parameters getcolumns=\"pdb,uniprot\", wherecolumn=\"species\", isvalue=\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", and limit=100, then utilize the protein_detail tool for each UniProt ID.",
  "expected_trajectory": "get_lectins -> protein_detail",
  "expected_answer": "The expected answer should include the list of UniProt IDs corresponding to lectins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, along with detailed protein information for each, focusing on their sequences, glycosylation sites, and any structural data related to these sites.",

    "reasoning": "The agent attempted to address the research question by using the UniLectin3D database to retrieve lectins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then tried to obtain detailed protein information using the protein_detail tool. However, the agent encountered SSL certificate errors when accessing the GlyGen API, which prevented it from retrieving the necessary protein details, including glycosylation sites. The agent then suggested using the UniProt API as an alternative, but this was not executed, and the final answer was based on hypothetical data rather than actual retrieval from the UniProt API. The agent's final response included speculative glycosylation sites and interactions without empirical data to support these claims.",
    "critical_issues": "1. Failure to retrieve actual glycosylation site data due to SSL errors. 2. Speculative final answer without empirical data from the UniProt API. 3. Lack of execution of the alternative approach using the UniProt API.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is compromised due to the lack of actual data retrieval. The agent's final answer included speculative glycosylation sites and interactions, which were not based on real data. This undermines the validity of the conclusions drawn about lectin-protein interactions.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent initially used the correct API (UniLectin3D) to retrieve lectins but failed to successfully use the protein_detail tool due to SSL errors. The suggestion to use the UniProt API was appropriate, but the agent did not execute this alternative approach, leading to a failure in obtaining the necessary data. The agent's workflow was logical in attempting to find an alternative solution, but it did not complete the task effectively.",
