  "question": "How many lectins with known structures are available that have been derived from the species 'Homo sapiens' in the UniLectin3D database, and what are their associated Protein Data Bank (PDB) IDs and fold types?",
  "expected_trajectory": "get_lectins",
  "expected_answer": "The response will include a list of lectins with their PDB IDs and fold types for those derived from 'Homo sapiens'. The key pieces of information will be the PDB IDs of the lectins and their structural fold classifications, reflecting the diversity of lectin structures known in human species. If the returned results are less than expected, this might indicate a limited scope of structurally-characterized human lectins in the database.",

    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by retrieving the number of lectins derived from Homo sapiens in the UniLectin3D database, along with their PDB IDs and fold types. The agent initially encountered a typo in the species name, which led to an empty result. However, the agent identified and corrected this error, re-running the query with the correct species name. This resulted in the retrieval of 517 lectins, with the agent providing a sample of the first few entries, including their PDB IDs and fold types. The agent's approach was logical, starting with tool discovery and handling the error gracefully by correcting the typo. The final answer was clear and concise, providing the necessary information requested in the research question.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is sound. The agent correctly interpreted the data from the UniLectin3D database, providing accurate PDB IDs and fold types for the lectins derived from Homo sapiens. The agent's understanding of protein-glycan interactions and database cross-references was appropriate for the task.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the appropriate API (my_custom_mcp-get_lectins) to address the research question. The workflow was logical, starting with tool discovery, correcting errors, and re-running the query to obtain the correct results. The agent effectively synthesized the data and presented it in a meaningful way, consistent with glycomics research practices.",
