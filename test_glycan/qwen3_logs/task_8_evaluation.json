  "question": "How does the glycosylation pattern of the protein associated with UniProt accession 'P14210' contribute to its disease associations and structural characteristics?",
  "expected_trajectory": "protein_detail",
  "expected_answer": "The expected output should include detailed information about the protein sequence and molecular mass, functional attributes, specific glycosylation sites, associated diseases linked to glycosylations, and any structural data available. This data would allow a researcher to analyze the relationship between the protein's glycosylation status and its role in disease pathology and structure-function relationships.",

    "reasoning": "The agent attempted to address the research question regarding the glycosylation pattern of the protein associated with UniProt accession 'P14210' (the insulin receptor) and its disease associations and structural characteristics. However, the agent encountered an SSL error when trying to use the `my_custom_mcp-protein_detail` API, which prevented it from retrieving detailed information directly from the GlyGen database. Instead, the agent relied on general knowledge and suggested alternative resources like UniProt and PDB for further exploration. While the agent provided a reasonable overview of the insulin receptor's glycosylation and its implications, it did not fully achieve the research objective due to the lack of specific data retrieval and integration from the intended API.",
    "critical_issues": "1. The agent failed to retrieve specific glycosylation site data and disease associations directly from the GlyGen API due to an SSL error. 2. The agent did not attempt alternative API calls or methods to overcome the SSL issue, such as using a different API or environment.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific information provided by the agent was generally accurate, describing the role of glycosylation in the insulin receptor's function and its association with diseases like diabetes and cancer. However, the lack of specific data from the API limits the depth and specificity of the analysis.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent correctly identified the `my_custom_mcp-protein_detail` API as the appropriate tool for retrieving detailed protein information. However, it did not handle the SSL error effectively or attempt alternative methods to obtain the necessary data. The agent's reliance on general knowledge and external resources, while informative, did not fully address the research question as expected.",
